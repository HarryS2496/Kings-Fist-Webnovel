<h3>750, 3rd of Quadedre</h3>

Gerwyn Ashwright finally made it to the top of the old watchtower.   

Not a guard, official, or soul had followed him here; this tower was a relic of old days no sane person wished to concern themselves with, lest they face the rumored spirits within.   

A frigid breeze passed through him as he opened and closed the rustic door. The daunting flight of stairs was now behind him, and the balcony at the top was in front of him.  

The balcony’s stone was soaked; the spring season had come to melt the snow away.   

Yet there was still a frigid breeze.  

He put his right hand on the chest and took a deep breath.  

*The edge here is 15 steps away.*  

He looked to the left at the sunset beyond the horizon, seeing the deepening blue closing in, giving way to the night. It gave him some peace of mind with every step, preferring not to focus on the sun that shone.  

His eyes looked around the kingdom he knew all too well: Ashwright.  

*9 more steps…*  

This kingdom was a land of grey, ash-colored snow and “might makes right,” hence its name. Long winters, buildings of heated stone and dark steel, and smog from forges and coal stretched across the realm’s reach.   

Beyond the kingdom, to the south, he saw tundra plains leading to a distant evergreen forest. A longing look lingered as he stared at the faraway trees that seemed to stretch for leagues.  

To any outsider, this land was no easy place to traverse to, but it gave warm welcomes to those it deemed worthy.  

Though it was home to its own unique delicacies, the most delectable one among its people was the camaraderie forged from hardship and strength. He had watched as warmth collided with frost as friends and family alike stood together in harmony.   

To the civilians – the Ashfolk – born here, it was a cherished bonfire to rest and rejuvenate the spirit.   

*2 more steps.*   

To Gerwyn, it was only frost.  

His eyes lowered to what was below him.  

A road of cobblestone, walked upon by no one in sight. Hours ago, it had been bustling with people going in and out of markets and vendors, but no one dared to come nearby when night began to fall near this tower. A few trees lined the road, withered by ashen snow beginning to melt. Steel entrances and gates stood undeterred, laced by frost and dripping water.   

*If I take 2 more steps here…*  

Despite its age, this tower was still one of the tallest buildings in Ashwright.   

*I can end this*.  

He knew that his remains would be unrecognizable if he fell from here.  

He raised his right foot.  

**THUMP.**  

His heart gave a violent kick, then became still for a moment.  

It was enough to make him stagger back.  

His legs trembled.  

*Not now. Move.*  

His mind commanded to raise his right foot again.  

**THUMP.**  

But his body did not listen.  

Nausea invaded the stomach.  

*Why…can’t I move?*  

Another command from the mind.   

**THUMP.**  

No movement from the body.  

His vision began to blur.  

*I…I can’t do it. I can’t even bring myself to escape.*  

His mind began to tremble along with his body, and he fell to his knees.  

**THUMP.**  

His right hand clawed at his chest, trying to get the heart inside back together.  

It was in vain.   

Tears silently fell as his left hand clutched the balcony rail.  

*I can’t even bring myself…to die.*  

The only response the world gave him was another frigid breeze.  

Silence.  

He looked to his left at the sunset again.   

This time, he looked at the sun. It bled a red orange as it sunk further into the night.   

Its flame had grown weaker, and it was on the verge of succumbing to nightfall.  

But something in its flame told him to get up.   

In the world of frost he lived in, it was the only sign of warmth left.  

Much time had passed since he opened the door to this balcony.  

His legs had fallen asleep from kneeling too long.   

He put both of his hands on the rail to support himself.   

His legs slowly awakened. They wobbled out of grogginess, then became stable.  

He turned away from the edge, and headed back to the rustic door.  

He had ascended this tower to die. Now, he was descending this tower to live.  

He wasn’t sure why, and he couldn’t stand himself for it.  

But he still lived, and his heart still pulsed.

<br>
<br>

The descent from the tower was heavier than the ascent.  

His legs did not shake when he climbed the short steps to the balcony.   

Now, they shook as he climbed down.  

It showed the difference between his resolve to die and his resolve to live.  

The resolve to die was a hardened ideal that left him unflinching in the face of the dilapidated architecture.  

The resolve to live was a newborn thought that could only wonder how he managed to climb the hollow ruins in the first place.  

He still didn’t understand why the thought kept him going.   

When he finally reached the bottom, the blue night had taken over the sky.  

His legs were exhausted, yet they moved with little purpose.  

He stared down at the cobblestone road as the tower became far.  

He heard the markets becoming quieter, but did not look up.  

He heard the taverns becoming louder, but did not look up.  

He heard a couple engaging in risque business in a narrow alleyway, but did not look up.  

He heard a foreign merchant shouting to sell the last of his goods, but did not look up.  

He heard two soldiers beating and dragging a purse snatcher, but did not look up.  

He heard children playing at a lot he once knew–  

*“Whatcha reading there, Jerry?”*  

His eyes darted back up and to the left.  

In that lot were two children, their faces blurry from where he stood.   

A girl with pointed ears, wearing a wolfish grin.   

A boy seen in the mirror for a time, looking at a book almost his size.  

He blinked. His vision became more clear as yet another frigid breeze embraced him.  

The two children were gone, and the lot was empty.   

The tree and grass of the past had vanished in the now. Only old cobblestone remained.  

He looked back at what was in front of him. It was the Ashwright castle.  

His legs resumed their journey, but the eyes did not stay on the road this time.  

As the castle became closer, his chest tightened, and he uttered a name.  

“Shen…”

<br>
<br>

He arrived at the castle entrance.   

The two guards at the front let him inside without a word.   

The warmth of the castle wrapped around him as he entered.  

He did not feel it even when the massive doors closed.  

Two advisors he recognized were deep in conversation.   

“...Do you know what Georg truly came here for? It’s suspicious that he’d disappear for five years and then come back so cheerful like that.” Zinzolin whispered, scratching his bald head.  

“It’s likely another act of his. Even I can’t tell where his thoughts start and end half the time.” she responded while adjusting her blackened hair into a ponytail. As her slender fingers moved, the magic in the silver rings each of them wore sung a dull tune he could just barely perceive.   

“Still, we’ll have to keep an eye on him. Some of the rumors aren’t without credibility, after all…”  

Both of them caught wind of Gerwyn’s presence as he walked through the hall. They bowed to him, and she was the first to speak.  

“Good evening to you, Lord Gerwyn. The family reunion dinner of the Ashwrights is starting soon, and they’ve been expecting you and Gehenna. Do you know where she is?”  

He shook his head.   

*I don’t. And I’d rather not find out.*  

“Ah, I see. Do not worry then, she will be informed of the reunion too. You should make your way over there soon; our majesty expects every child of his to attend this time.”  

He nodded. As they looked back up at him, he saw *it* in their eyes for a brief moment.  

*It* made him flinch and step back.   

Regaining his composure, he continued to walk down the hall, gaze lowered to the maroon carpet on the floor.   

He overheard muttering from Zinzolin that was quickly silenced by a shush from Jadeqen, but did not catch the details of what they said.   

His exhausted mind did not bother to piece together why Georg would suddenly come back here after five years of deafening silence.  

There was no need to.  

His legs instinctively took a left, but he forced them to turn right, toward the dining room.  

Retreating to his chambers was obviously not an option here.  

This was an uncommon instance where he’d be at the dining table with his entire family.  

*It shouldn’t appear as long as I don’t speak.*  

He arrived at the metal door guarding the dining room, legs still weary.  

The steel chilled his hand as it hovered over the knob.  

*It shouldn’t appear as long as I don’t feel.*  

The door creaked open.  

He saw the dining table, strewn with dimly lit candles, napkins, and silverware. Behind the table, the fireplace roared.  

There, at the table head, sat King Sherman Ashwright and Queen Beatrice Ashwright.   

His father, wearing that same gaunt expression he still couldn’t get a proper read on.  

And his mother, whose elegance and disposition could freeze without a spell.   

“Oh hello, Gerwyn. Good of you to finally come. Go ahead and take your seat while we wait on Gehenna.” said his mother Beatrice, her lips curved into a slight smile.   

*It* flashed in her eyes.  

Gerwyn did not flinch this time, but he stood for a moment before slowly walking to his seat at the table. It was at the bottom end of the left side – close enough to the door, far enough not to be noticed.  

Plopping onto the chair, he finally gave his legs a chance to rest.  

A quick scan of the table confirmed the presence of nearly every sibling.  

Each one had a designated nickname in his mind.  

On his side were Nadis, Victor, and an empty seat to his left.   

Nadis, the Quiet. Her relaxed posture kept her blended into the room’s darkness, even when near her parents and the fireplace.   

Victor, the Authority. He was a harsh beacon that pierced the table with the commanding look he wore into combat and meetings.  

Gerwyn looked at the others across from him, from left to right.  

Georg, the Shatterer. His closed eyes and polite smirk had not changed even after all these years. Though he sat far away, Gerwyn felt the towering presence of a shadow.   

Lily, the Prodigy. She imitated Victor’s stern posture, chin raised a bit too high to be taken seriously.  

Mercer, the Fury. He impatiently tapped a finger on the table and grumbled something unintelligible when Gerwyn sat down.   

Pendra, the Joker. He slouched in his chair, one hand supporting the face while another fiddled with a spoon. It was clear from his expression alone that he had been dying of boredom in his seat for a while now.   

Not long after Gerwyn got comfortable, the silence broke.  

“Damn, what’s with this table right now?” Pendra said with some incredulousness. “Here we are, getting ready to have dinner as a family, yet you’ve all been scowling like it’s a funeral. Don’t you think that’s the opposite of a warm welcome to our oldest brother while he’s telling us his stories?”   

“Ah, you understand it well, Pendra.” Georg smoothly responded as he adjusted his slicked back hair. “I feel rather hurt right now, Father. The first of the new generation of Ashwrights comes back after a long journey of soul-searching, and *this* is the kind of family reunion I’m given? I see some things around here haven’t changed a bit.”  

Victor’s stern voice cut through. “You two still have much to learn about our conduct as Ashwrights. We must know when silence is necessary, whether in battle or in conversation.”  

“Ugh, here we go with this again.” Pendra groaned while rolling his eyes.  

“Pendra, this is important, and you will–”  

“Yeah, important enough in a war council, Vic. But we’re not in a war council, are we? Seriously, your uptightness is becoming the actual bad influence here. Just look at Lily; she’s trying to look cool by doing an impression of you.”  

Lily was flustered for a moment, then snapped back. “Hey, watch your tongue there, *Penny*\! You talk quite a lot for someone who lost that duel against me earlier.”  

“Great, now you’re getting his giant head too. Quit getting those big ideas just cause you happen to fight like our father here, *kiddo*.”  

“Yeah? Well, this *kiddo’s* already much stronger than you’ll–”  

“*Aarrrgh*, would you two just shut the *hell* up already\!?” Mercer yelled while slamming his fists onto the table. “Every time you both open your *godsdamned* mouths, it’s like listening to a quail being strangled to death\!\!”  

“Mercer, do not slam the table.” Beatrice said coolly. “And refrain from such language when everyone is present; you’ll corrupt Lily’s innocence.”  

“Mother\!” Lily gasped, flustered again. “I’m 12\! I’m big enough to handle his words\!”  

“Tch, yeah, only 12.” Mercer remarked with disdain.  

“I–”  

“What did I say about *shutting.* The *hell. Up*.”  

She withdrew the statement, but her face carried a defiant pout.  

Mercer exhaled, then continued. “And I do apologize, Mother. It’s just…*difficult* to keep it together. Here we are at this table, with our famed commander and these 2 brats next to my ears talking up a storm about some brainless nonsense. Meanwhile, the rest of us are forced to wait because some *crippled wretch* and a *conniving harlot* love taking their sweet time before–”  

“*Mercer*.” The dim candles nearly froze as Beatrice spoke.   

Gerwyn did not wince.   

He knew who Mercer was talking about.  

Everyone else did, but such things were left unsaid.  

Pendra resumed the conversation before the atmosphere could fully freeze over.  

“I’d like to apologize on my big brother's behalf, Your Majesty.” He put a hand on Mercer’s shoulder. “Lord Mercer Ashwright over here has been on a losing streak against me, Lily, and Nadis for the past few days, and now he’s gotta think about it while on an empty stomach.”  

Mercer turned to him with a fierce scowl while breaking his grasp away. “You are *this* close to–”  

“–Close to *absolutely nothing*.” spoke a poised voice as the door opened.   

It was Gehenna.   

Or as he preferred to call her in his head, the Viper.   

“Oh, look who finally showed up.” Mercer snapped as she walked in.  

“You’re late.” Victor added.  

“What took you so long, big sis?” Lily inquired.  

“Apologies, apologies. I’ve just been kept busy by some loose ends lately.” Gehenna said as she brushed some of her long hair to her back.   

Gerwyn caught a glimpse of a dagger belt and hilt around her left thigh.  

Pendra cocked an eyebrow. “What kind of ‘loose ends’ could have made you late enough to make us starve like this?”   

“Far more nuanced work than your silly competitions on those grounds, *Penny*.” she replied as she took the one seat left at the table. “I also heard a wild mutt barking something about a *‘conniving harlot’* from across the hall, so I just *had* to walk as slow as possible to keep him starving longer.”  

“Tch, nothing says ‘nuanced work’ like gossiping with anything that moves.” Mercer retorted while glaring at her.  

Gerwyn sighed. Even in a family dinner where every child except him and Pendra had training gear on, his twin sister still couldn’t help but show off her new cobalt dress and buttery tongue. Unlike him, she kept her chin held high in the face of the table’s scorn, uncaring about the consequences of her tardiness.  

“Gods, what a farce this is.” Victor cut in again, exasperated. “Father arranged this as a meeting of Ashwright’s royals; all of you must play your parts instead of bickering like this.”  

*Pendra’s right about him. Ashwright or not, those words aren’t fitting for a dinner table.*   

“Mercer, I know not where or why this anger of yours has been around since youth, but it *must cease*.   

Pendra and Lily – you two must support each other instead of talking about ‘wins’ and ‘losses’ like some kind of childish game.”   

Pendra rolled his eyes again while Lily proudly nodded.  

Victor turned to his right.   

“And as for you two–”  

“It is fine.”   

The king’s deep voice cut him off.   

“We are not merely royals.   

We are bound by blood.   

There is a time for lectures, and it is not at this table.   

It is at the training grounds instead.”  

Victor opened his mouth to speak, but then immediately shut it.   

Sherman continued, his words short and succinct.   

“We are here as a reminder that we are bound by blood.   

Hard times loom over this kingdom…no thanks to our rivals.  

Lambda…Bastionne…Fulmen…Xaede…Yomi.   

They grow stronger. Smarter.   

Our relations with Lambda and Xaede are still in jeopardy.”  

The girl in the abandoned lot flashed back in Gerwyn’s mind.  

*Shen…*  

“Our people become unsure of us, both in this kingdom and in neighboring lands.  

Therefore…we must sharpen ourselves even more.  

We must stand united, as Ashwright’s greatest weapons.  

We must prove to them why our name is etched in the annals of history.”  

After a brief pause, Beatrice continued.  

“Savor this supper, for greater trials await afterwards.  

My lord and I beseech many of you to stand resolute tomorrow.”  

Gerwyn felt the burn of a glare he didn’t need to see to know it was Lily’s.  

*Many of you. There’s a reason she said that. Mother won’t say it, but I know I’m exempt.*  

Being exempt from the “greater trials” would bring the average person some relief.   

But he felt none of it.   

He knew from firsthand experience that in this far-from-average household, this exemption was a sinister omen.  

*It* thrived off sinister omens.  

Sherman snapped his fingers.   

“Servants. It is time.”  

Four maids came with the main dishes for the night: a magnificent ham glistening with oil and sauce and draped in an assortment of vegetables. To the sides: a golden-crusted blueberry pie, and a whole fried fish so fresh it still held a faint scent of sea air. The food was portioned out methodically for everyone at the table.  

The smell of the fish immediately brought a glint of excitement to Lily.  

“We must stand united, eh? Well now, that’s rather unlike you, Father.” Georg said lightly while taking a piece out of his pie slice. “Do you hear that, Victor? Your sermons are getting so stale, even Father is desperate for a more interesting conversation. And speaking of interesting things to talk about…”  

He looked at the table’s farthest seat away from him.  

“*Gerwyn.*”  

**THUMP.**  

All eyes at the table turned towards him. He saw *It* in their eyes.  

He flinched, struggling to find the courage to look back. His gaze lowered to the polished table, trying to concentrate on anything else in the room. Its focus directed to the sounds of silverware and plates as the servants prepared the food, praying what they’d serve would divert the conversation.  

Georg continued, still smiling. “It’s been quite a while, hasn’t it? You haven’t said a word, yet you look like you’ve been run ragged.”  

*It* remained sealed in his closed eyes. Gerwyn knew it was there.  

“Come to think of it…you do look more exhausted than usual, dear brother.” Gehenna added, narrowing her gaze as she studied his face.  

*It* hid behind shadows in her eyes.  

The way they narrowed twisted a knife into his ribs.  

“Gehenna’s one case,” Pendra chimed in, “but you being late is kinda unusual, so…” He gestured lazily. “What kept you busy earlier?”  

*It* flickered in his eyes.   

Gerwyn did not respond; he knew Pendra was good at catching lies.   

Knowing himself, if he tried to speak now, even the truth would sound suspicious. But…  

*‘I almost ended my own life.’ Are you truly sure that’s what you want to hear?*  

Mercer clicked his tongue again. “This is seriously what you call an ‘interesting conversation’, Georg? You're all wasting your breath here. What are you expecting him to say – ‘Oh, I read another forgotten fable’ or ‘Er, I went on another stroll today’. Give me a break.”  

*It* seethed in his eyes.  

The scathing did not surprise Gerwyn, yet it still stung.   

He hoped it was enough to divert the topic to something – anything else.  

“Hey, you never know, Mercer. Maybe this time, he went on a soul-searching walk throughout the entire kingdom, the wind as his one sacred compatriot\!” Pendra grinned as he made wild gestures.  

“Yes, a soul-searching walk through a few streets and a bookstore.” Lily exhaled in sharp disappointment at the current subject. “It’s more likely he didn’t want to come here; he wasn’t there to watch the spars today.”  

*It* glowed in her eyes.  

“Lily.” Beatrice and Gehenna warned in unison.  

“What? You both know I’m right. So is Mercer.” Lily declared without faltering.   

Silence. It briefly locked the room as Gehenna and Lily stared daggers at each other.  

*…What’s so important to them about what I did today?*  

“If he came here exhausted, it wouldn’t be from slacking off.” Nadis said calmly. “It’s more likely he did go on a long walk today. You need to sharpen your perception, Lily.”   

Victor’s large frame and the distance between them obfuscated his vision of her.   

He could not tell if *it* was in her eyes. No part of his soul had the curiosity to find out.  

“Hey, Nadis\! What’s with you taking his side so suddenly?” Lily exclaimed again. “You better not be getting a big head just because you have some ‘adventurer’s experience’\!”  

Nadis did not respond. She only took a sip of water from her glass cup.  

“Well?” Victor said, turning his head towards Gerwyn. “You’ve been asked a question.”  

*It* burned in his eyes.  

*Why…?*  

This silent treatment wasn’t going to work anymore.  

*It* hungered for an answer.  

Gerwyn swallowed a lump in his throat.   

His voice cracked when it finally came.   

“I-I…went to…the watchtower…today.”  

*It* silently tore at him.   

The servants had finally set down each dish.  

A serving of crisp fish, glistening ham, vegetables, and blueberry pie for all 10 of them.   

They began to eat.   

Gerwyn attempted to swiftly finish his meal without notice. The vegetables were first.  

The silence did not disappear.  

*It* did not disappear.  

Eventually, Lily broke the silence, blinking in surprise.   

“The watchtower? You don’t mean…that tower near District B? Gods…why would you spend time somewhere so *creepy*\!? They used to keep prisoners there, you know\!”  

“Daring today, eh? You’ve definitely got more guts than Lily here, strolling into a cursed place like that.” Pendra said before taking a big bite out of some ham.  

“Shaddap\!” Lily spoke with fish in her mouth.  

“So did you see any ghosts there, Gerwyn?” Pendra asked, mid-chew. “Did any of them talk to you? Were any of them adventurers with tales and regrets galore?” He scarfed another few bites. “Was one of them our unwritten ancestors?”  

Lily shot a look at Pendra as she took another bite out of her fish. “Penny, he’s not–”  

“*Ugh*, have you two learned *nothing* from those etiquette lessons?” Gehenna recoiled in disgust. “Eat or talk, *do not* do both.”  

“Madness, Gerwyn.” Victor snapped. “Do you realize that place is condemned for a reason? Never mind the history behind it, the broken architecture makes it unsafe to climb. None of us have business there, so *why* did you–”  

“Enough, Victor.” Nadis cut him off.  

The eyes turned.   

**THUMP.**  

Gerwyn clutched his heart with his left hand for a moment when nobody saw him, unable to numb the fluctuating tension at this table.   

*Why…?*  

“The top of that tower is rather peaceful, actually.” she continued while wiping crumbs off her mouth. “There’s a serene wind and a nice view of this kingdom from so far up. I’ve been there before; it’s a good place to read or collect your thoughts.”   

She raised a finger to accentuate her next point.   

“But it’s a risky trek, whether you’re going up or down. Even veterans need to be meticulous around the short steps and lack of rails. If he did that alone, of course he’d take a while to come back here.”  

Her calm and collected explanation eased the tension, if only for a brief moment.   

Gerwyn’s heart remained erratic, fearful of *It.*  

His right hand unconsciously clenched into a fist.  

*Why…is this normal to them?*  

“Ah, I see.” Georg said while slightly amused. “Rather unexpected, but it does answer my question. Hard to fathom making that dangerous climb just to do some reading…but I’ll take your word for it, Nadis.”  

“If you’re Gerwyn, perhaps it’s not so unfathomable; nothing deters my twin from finding a good place to read.” Gehenna immediately spoke.   

*Why…does this keep…happening?*  

“And as for you, Victor, is that any way to treat one of your brethren? He just climbed a tower that you and Georg cower in fear of, can’t you praise him for that instead? For a change, he accomplished something you didn’t.”  

Victor opened his mouth to snap back, but–  

“Oh, you wound me, little sister.” Georg spoke with initiative. “It is impressive for his standing, I just don’t like *throwing my life away* for some peace and quiet in my own homeland.”  

**THUMP.**  

His pulse beat louder, his knuckles became whiter, and his vision started to blur.  

*There’s nothing impressive about it…I did throw my life away.*  

“Let us not start a fire over this, children.” Beatrice’s voice rang out. “What matters is that Gerwyn went on a long walk and came back. Is there anything wrong with that?”   

Sherman nodded his head. “It too, is training. A good walk is a step towards strength.”  

*Why do they keep this act up, knowing that It is in their eyes?*  

“It’ll put you a step farther from an inevitable epitaph.” Mercer muttered while stabbing his fish.  

“Final warning, *Mercer*.” Beatrice sternly commanded.   

**THUMP.**  

Her command shut the room down for a moment.   

Mercer’s rage was silenced, but Gerwyn’s nerves were not.  

*Why does this heart always–*  

**Crack.**  

Something broke in his fist, and he became conscious of it again.   

The sound cleared his vision. Somehow, it was unheard by everyone else at the table.   

Victor was continuing a point about why climbing the tower wasn’t safe while the rest of the table tried to shut him down. Gerwyn didn’t bother listening; his mind was focused on that sound.   

He looked down and saw a metal fork he had held the entire time.  

*When did I–*  

He uncurled the fist.   

The fork had been bent twice around the middle. It was slightly crushed.  

*What the…?*  

A maid passing through to hand extra napkins had taken notice of what was in his right hand. Her eyes widened and she put a hand to her mouth in shock. She silently slipped him a spare fork in exchange for the broken one. He nodded slightly as a form of thanks, but caught her gaze as she bowed back.  

*It* glinted in her eyes.  

He got back to eating, remaining unseen by the rest of the table.   

**THUMP.**  

He chose not to focus any more attention to Georg and Pendra debating the validity of the former’s tales around the world, Victor’s exasperation at his older brother’s wild claims, Gehenna and Lily debating about manners, or Mercer continuing his passive aggressive remarks towards everyone.   

Each bite was a silent step closer to escaping this tunnel that suffocated him.   

He finished the main course and looked at his slice of pie. The shine of the dark blueberry sauce as it oozed out became nauseating to look at. After already feeling full, he did not have the will to handle something bursting with such sweetness.   

*I need to get away; there's no reason to stay here.*  

A hand felt his left shoulder. It was Gehenna’s.  

**THUMP.**  

Sharp shivers spiked down his back at the sudden touch.  

“Gerwyn?” she asked, concerned. “You still haven’t said much, and you don’t look well. What’s wrong?”  

He knew that she could see through him.   

Beneath that concern – that mask, *It* still lurked in her eyes.   

Gerwyn snapped his arm away from her grasp, much to her surprise.  

“It’s nothing.” he mumbled.  

He got up from his seat and walked to the door.  

“Hey, wait, you’re done already?” Pendra called.  

“Gerwyn\! This is an important gathering, get back to your seat\!” Victor barked.  

“Calm down. The important part of this dinner has long passed.” Beatrice responded.   

He looked back to the head of the table.   

“Thank you for your time.” Beatrice said with a cold smile.  

“You may go.” Sherman added, his face still a gaunt scowl.  

*It* surged in his eyes.  

Gerwyn’s vision saw the entire room, now silent again.   

*It* was everywhere in their eyes.   

**THUMP.**  

He quickly shut the door on the way out.  

As he stopped to take a deep breath, the muffled voices of his family were heard.   

“And there he goes.” Lily announced. “What’s wrong with him?”  

“Well, if he’s not gonna touch his pie, guess I’ll take it.” said Pendra.  

“That tower is one issue, but he still refuses to talk…” muttered Victor.   

“In other news, the sky is blue and it’s cold outside.” Mercer grumbled loudly.  

“Enough, children.” Beatrice sighed. “Honestly…”  

Their voices disappeared as he walked back down the hall, clutching the chest.  

*I knew It was going to appear, yet this thing is still in pain…*
