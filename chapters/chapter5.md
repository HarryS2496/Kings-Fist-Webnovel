As Victor swung again, Gehenna caught on to the feint this time.

The same trick where he closed his eyes again wasn’t fooling her twice. 

While leaping directly into his left, she struck at his gripped hands before he could hit her with the hilt again.

His grip on the blade loosened for a moment, but the pain wasn’t enough to let go.

He focused his hands into tightening his grip even further, but even a minor act at such a close range proved fatal.

She brought the wooden knife to the center of his neck, forcing him to freeze.

After too many close calls and near-stalemates, the duel had finally ended. 

This was her first victory against a commander of Ashwright. 

“I…concede,” he admitted. “Well done.” 
 
She heaved a sigh of relief, drew her blade back to the belt, and took a small cloth out from her pocket to wipe her forehead, now holding its own layer of sweat.  

Whatever enthralling conversation was happening on the sidelines, Lily and Pendra had ended it abruptly to cheer on her newfound victory.   

The former ran up to see if both of them were okay.   

Nadis followed suit, but Gehenna could immediately tell from the sparks in her right hand that she wasn’t coming to give mere praise and consolation.  

*Did something tick her off earlier? She’s giving Lily a glare. Whatever it is, now’s the time to keep quiet. I’ve never seen Nadis look like that, and it would be best not to find out.*  

Victor planted his wooden greatsword back onto the solid ground and leaned into it to keep his aching body supported. If Nadis didn’t put one hand on his shoulder, he would have collapsed to his knees.  

“I’m going to spar with Lily now. Go rest, you’ve done more than enough.”  

“Wait…” he panted. “I still…need to–”  

“No, you don’t.” Her grip tightened.  

“Nadis–”  

“I *said*, no, you don’t. Go *rest*.”   

The sharpness in her low voice broke Victor’s final chances at regaining control.   

Resignation flickered in his face.  

“Gehenna.” Nadis handed Victor off to her with a gesture. Her glare, still fresh with electricity, pierced through.  

She did not need to elaborate any further. Gehenna helped him walk back without question. As she put one of his arms around her shoulder, she glanced back at Nadis, who had now directed her attention to Lily.  

*Why does that feel so familiar…?*  

Suddenly, Gerwyn’s look as he walked off earlier today came back.   

*It’s because of their eyes.*   

Their eyes now shared a flame of determination she could not decipher.  

The connection sent a chill down her spine.

<br>
<br>

However, the fists of Gerwyn Ashwright no longer wavered under such chills.  
*297…298…299…300…*

<br>
<br>

Victor unlatched himself from Gehenna’s grasp and slumped down on the right of the bench. Pendra slid over to the middle of the bench to make way for him and irritate Mercer at the same time.   

*Gerwyn and Nadis have been the only ones acting differently today. It’s already one thing that they share that unreadable silence, but now they’re both…oddly proactive.*   

She stood right where Nadis once was and comfortably sunk into her role as an observer of an unfamiliar battle. As Lily drew her wooden sword and moved to her starting position, she and Gehenna looked at each other, exchanging a similar sentiment of confusion.   

*I still don't get you, Nadis.*   

Gehenna did not need to keep seeing her older sister’s face to feel the pressure of the determined stare she fixated onto their little sister.   

*It’s clear you want much more out of Lily than “perception,” but…what, exactly? And why?*  

As Victor finally settled down on the bench, he pulled out a cloth from one of his belt bags and wiped off the rest of the sweat on his forehead with it.   

Contemplation mired his face as he solemnly leaned forward.  

“Now that’s what we call a good match\!” said Pendra to Gehenna. “Honestly, I wasn’t sure who was going to win there. It felt like an entire day passed during the fight.”  

“Why, thank you, Pendra.” Gehenna replied with a sweet smile. “Consider that a demonstration to never underestimate your elders, including the ones who show up “late.”  

“Elders? Come on now, you’re not that old. We’re only two years apart here, Gehenna. Or…” His eyes widened at the formation of another wild idea. “Don’t tell me…you got your first gray hair\!? How’d that happen?”  

“It wouldn’t be surprising if I did after that ordeal,” she sighed while examining a stray hair strand. “You certainly weren’t joking when you said you wouldn’t hold back, Victor.”  

He did not respond, for he had buried his face into the damp, sweaty cloth.

<br>
<br>

*400…401…402…403…*

<br>
<br>

“Hey, um…Nadis?” asked Lily.  

Nadis looked right at her and tilted her head. An opportunity to continue.  

“What happened between you and Victor?”  

“Nothing worth any words. Right now…”   

She drew out her spear with one swift flourish.  

“...this comes first.”  

“Hey, I’ve seen you glaring at him ever since morning\! The least you could do is help while he’s down\!” protested Lily.  

“I already did. Rest is the best thing that can help that fool now.”  

“Don’t think you can get away with calling him that.” she declared as she drew her wooden sword and pointed it at her. Though agitation struck Lily, enough discipline gave her the incentive to calmly stand her ground. “Just because you’re older doesn’t mean you can order a commander like that\! Maybe it *is* that ‘adventurer’s experience’ that’s giving you the big head here\!”  

“Experience is experience, no matter the name. What matters is that *you* still need more of it.” Nadis sighed while rolling her neck.   

“Fine then, I’ll take you on, but on one condition\! The winner–”  

“–chooses a penalty for the loser. And no, I refuse.”  

Lily, agape with shock, let her sword waver.   

“You told Pendra those exact words the other day.” Nadis flatly added.   

“I–that’s–wha–you–”   

Lily’s words failed her in the face of an adventurer’s intuition. She violently shook her head to dissipate the fog under her thoughts, returning to her original composure.  

“What are you talking about? The condition’s part of the duel\! If you refuse, that means you’re backing out\!”  

“Any warrior who relies on ‘*conditions*’ to bring life to a duel is *no true warrior*.”   

“Yes, well…” Her original composure in question fluctuated in the face of Nadis’s palpable presence. It wavered again, then came back with another idea. “I seem to recall this was supposed to be about perception. And according to many a scripture, sharpening perception means knowing more about what’s the deal between you and your brother, doesn’t it? So that means that if I win, you’re going to tell me what’s going on between you and him\!”  

“No, the textbook definition of ‘sharpening your perception’ means learning how to figure that part out yourself. It also means learning that these ‘conditions’ will not save you in a true battle.”  

“That won’t stop me from what I want.” Lily vowed.   

A faint, yet palpable aura of fire and ice crackled and shrouded her as she gripped her sword with both hands and took her stance.  

“...You want to know that badly, hm?” said Nadis. “Very well. But if I win, you will never shackle another duel with ‘conditions’ ever again.”  

“What, between us or forevermore?”  

“Forevermore.”  

“Alright, then I really can’t lose\!” Lily flashed a grin as she took her stance. “Get ready, Nadis\! With the strength of our lineage and the fruits of my efforts, you will not remain standing against the grand might of Ashwright’s eighth successor\!\!”  

As Nadis readied her focus, a thought crossed.  

*Something tells me the “fruits of your efforts” lie in paltry theatrics instead, little girl.*

<br>
<br>

*501…502…503…504…*

<br>
<br>

As the two sisters began their duel, the rest of the siblings fell into their role as observers.  

“Damn, she’s already holding nothing back. Good thing she didn’t pick me first.” Pendra commented.  

“This is Nadis we speak of; she never holds back.” replied Gehenna. “Though it seems she has something out for Lily specifically today. If I may ask, what brought that on?”  

“I dunno, what do you think brought it on?” said Mercer. “That little shit brought this on herself.”  

“Not another word, Mercer.” growled Victor, still burying his face in a towel.  

“What? It’s the truth. Thanks to a certain few *wretches*, she’s been getting some big ideas about being above the rest of us. Someone’s gotta keep her in line.”  

“Oh? Now I’m curious. Who are these *few wretches* you speak of?” inquired Gehenna.  

“You already know.”  

“Anywho\!” Pendra clapped his hands together, predicting yet another bitter staredown before it could commence. “Mercer’s language aside, he’s not entirely wrong, but…” He then ruffled his head in a moment of deliberation. “There’s probably a better way to teach her a lesson about biting off more than she can chew, right? Pride of Ashwright or no, there’s no reason an experienced adventurer needs to go all out against a little kid.”  

“To be fair, you’d be wrong on that front anyways.” called a laid back voice from a fair distance off. “Because this is far from the full extent of what Nadis can do.”  

Mercer, Gehenna, and Pendra all looked to their left, surprised by the sudden interjection.  

Georg Ashwright had arrived on the field.

<br>
<br>

*606…607…608…609…*

<br>
<br>

Lily frantically weaved in and out of Nadis’s thrusts, desperate to find an opening.  

Though the look she had inspired confidence, Nadis knew all too well how to break it.  

*Arrogance must be broken before it becomes true confidence.*  

With just the shaft of her spear and her back turned, she parried a blow Lily had charged magic into.  

*So I’ll just do this\!*  

Nadis planted the back of her spear into Lily’s stomach, taking all the air out of her lungs and forcing her to reel back. The tip of the spear was then brought up to her neck.  

“Had this been a real fight, you’d die after such a reckless move.” Nadis commented, staring down at her little sister.  

“So what if I got careless once?” Lily said as she caught her breath. “We’re doing this again\! And this time, I won’t fold so easily\!”  

“We’ll see about that, then. Oh, and by the way, even if you win any subsequent duels from here, your win condition from here on out will be null and void.”  

“Huh\!?”  

“The conditions we laid out counted for this fight that you just lost. If I recall correctly, I believe I said that if I won, you would never shackle another duel with conditions ever again.”  

“That’s not fair at all, though\! Neither of us specified that it would be for this fight\! These are the kinds of things you’d have to keep a score for\!”  

Though subtle, Nadis could feel her left eye twitch.  

*By the seven, Victor, what did you put in her head?*  

“The battlefield isn’t fair either, and you’ll have to see it at some point. It’s not a place where things like ‘score’ belong.”  

Lily clicked her tongue in annoyance. “Ahhh, forget it, let’s just continue from here\! I’m not walking away from these grounds without one victory against you\!”  

*Don't bother with the last word, Nadis. Remain patient, you're looking at a mere student.*  

With little hesitation, the two immediately clashed again.

<br>
<br>

*710…711…712…713…*

<br>
<br>

“You see that? A second round and she still hasn’t lost momentum.” Georg remarked.  

“Have you been watching the spars from afar this whole time?” Gehenna asked.   

“Oh, no, I just got here after a rather busy morning,” he answered. “It’s just rather easy to infer what’s gone down since I left. I’ve fought alongside Nadis, after all.”  

“Well, if you can ‘infer’ it all so well, let’s hear it. What do you think you missed here, snake?” asked Mercer, irritated by Georg’s sudden arrival.  

“Heh, it’s quite simple, really.” chuckled the eldest brother. “Victor exhausted himself to near death trying to teach all of you, so now Nadis is taking out her frustrations with him on Lily. Ah, and are those chain marks I see on the neck there? 
The only way that could have happened is if you somehow let Mercer choke you out earlier, little brother.”  


“Not helping, Georg.” Victor grumbled as his face was still buried in a towel.  

“And what do you mean by ‘let’? Our commander here gave it everything he had and still folded before me; you don’t just let someone choke you out of some twisted pity.” said Mercer.  

“Oh, I’m sure he gave it his all. I’ll need to see it in person about three extra times to truly believe you didn’t just catch lightning in a bottle.” said Georg, unfazed and smiling in the face of the inferno he chose to ignite.  

“Don’t test me, now.” growled Mercer. The inferno's source seethed and smoldered in his eyes.

“And why not? I’m just curious to see if you can replicate a victory like that without needing to strike the audience as some sort of distraction.”  

A lasting wave of shock overcame the other spectators except for Victor.

<br>
<br>

*820…821…822…823…*

<br>
<br>

“Holy shit, how in the name of the gods did you know that?” Pendra finally said, easily the most flabbergasted by Georg’s deduction.  

“For three reasons, little brother. The first is because well, you don’t often see Victor the Great in a defeated state like this, but he’d be reeling from worse if Nadis went all out against him. The second is that slight swole that you keep feeling on your wrist there, Gehenna.”  

Gehenna too was in disbelief, but kept some semblance of composure. “O-oh, astute observation there, Georg. But those are still rather wild guesses to make out of a situation, don’t you think? There’s still other possibilities to take into account, and a chance your guesses could be far off the mark on them, you know.”  

“Not when considering the third reason; because you just told me the answer with your faces alone.” he replied coolly.  

Mercer clicked his tongue while Gehenna and Pendra looked back at each other.  

Nobody had a response to challenge his deduction.   

Now that the oldest sibling arrived, any conversation on the sidelines was at his mercy.

<br>
<br>

*934…935…956…957…*

<br>
<br>

As Lily thrust her blade forward in a flurry, Nadis sidestepped.  

*From afar, she does follow our father’s way of the sword. But…*  

The prodigy gained control of the offensive, but it had yet to be complete.  

*No matter how sincerely one imitates as a form of flattery, it’s still flattery.*  

Nadis planted her spear into the ground to vault herself into the air.  

*And flattery gets a warrior nowhere.*  

“Seriously\!?” Lily exclaimed “That’s–”  

**FWRRACKLE.**  

The spear sped down at lightning speed, blessed by the midday sun. It unleashed a burst of electricity and smoke upon hitting the ground.  

Though Lily had the reflexes to leap sideways, even a moment of blindness and surprise debilitated her balance, and thus, her awareness of her current surroundings.  

Before she could find the second to recover, Nadis already knew how to take advantage of it. She quickly descended upon the ground to pick up the spear, then found a blind spot in the smoke to grab Lily from a blindspot.  

The smoke quickly cleared to reveal that she was holding Lily by the back of her neck in one hand and pointing the spear into her back with the other. Another swift victory.  

“Damn it\!” Lily shouted. “Again\!”  

Nadis released her grip and let the prodigy take her stance.  

“You’ll never defeat me by playing around in the shadow of Ashwright’s king like this.” she said while discharging leftover static in her right hand.   

“Jokes on you, I know what I’m doing here.” Lily retorted as she caught her breath and regained her stance. “Father’s swordsmanship is second to none for a good reason: it’s about being quick as you exploit your enemy’s weaknesses by going–”  

“For the human body’s important vitals, then overwhelming them once there’s little they can do anymore. Do you really think I’d forget word of mouth such as that either?” Nadis frowned.  

Lily found herself overcome by agape shock once again.  

“Hey, quit trying to predict everything I’m saying and just listen *already*\! Just because you’re older–”  

“Provide a less predictable conversation I’ve heard time and again, and I’ll consider it. If you cannot even do that much, then prepare yourself for this next round *already*.”  

“But it’s been years since you last came home, right? I just think it’s important to remind you of these things so you don’t forget where–.”  

“I’ve got far more concerns above these ‘important things’ you and Victor want me to care about so badly, *kid*.” Nadis felt her patience wavering, and it wasn’t from the adrenaline that lingered in the sparks she emanated. “There’s far more to our father’s blade than what you imitate and hear in the legends.”  

“Don’t you dare call my sword an imitation\! Someday, I’ll surpass Father, both in the legends and truth alike\!\! And the first step to doing that…is by beating you right here\!\!”  

Nadis instantly put her guard up as Lily dashed forward towards her. Though the latter did not regain the offensive like she hoped, she managed to bring the both of them right back into exchanges more intense than the previous rounds.  

*This is going to take a long while.*

<br>
<br>

“1058…1059…1060…1061…”  
*I don’t know how long of a while it’s been.*  
The weariness had already begun to take its hold.

<br>
<br>

“So, uh…Georg.” Pendra struck a conversation in the palpable silence of the sidelines.  

“What’s up, little brother?”  

“So you said this was far from the full extent of Nadis’s power, right? I take it that means you’ve fought alongside her, haven’t you?”   

“Of course I have, though…it’s more like I’ve just watched her from the sidelines in the days we traveled together.”

<br>
<br>

“1062…1063…1064…1065…” 

With a slowed pace and ragged breaths, Gerwyn felt his trance shaking.  

*Gods, it feels like my arms are about to fall off the further I go.*

<br>
<br>

“Do not lie to our brethren here, Georg. You *did* fight alongside her.” interjected Victor. He had recovered somewhat from his exhaustion, but had yet to properly freshen up.  

“Only in the brief time you hung around us, though. And the only reason for that was because you kept shouting in tears at me to ‘be a brother and protect your precious sister.’ Couldn’t just sit back and let the adorable little one bawl his eyes out that time.”  

“That’s because during that time–”

<br>
<br>

“1066…1067…1068…hahh…”  

Each jab became heavier than the last.  

*I’ll need some energy to scale back down the tower, so…*

<br>
<br>

“Aww, he just called you adorable, Victor\!” Gehenna beamed with a smile mixed with smugness and amazement. “I wish I could have been around your age to see that in person, Lord Georg\!”   

“Y’know, I can already imagine it in some way now.” Pendra chimed in. “A young, little Victor, age twelve, trying to play the role of the protective knight for Nadis of all people. ‘Get your filthy hands away from my dear sister\! She’s still a maiden I have to protect\!’ Heheh, imagine that\!”  

“I already can, and I hope it’s true\! Please tell us it’s the truth, Georg.” Gehenna pleaded.  

“He was just a bit above your age at the time I’m currently thinking of, and the scowl *you* used to impersonate him was more furrowed, but everything else stands as fact.” confirmed Georg, amused at their intuition.  

“Not another *word\!*” Victor declared.

<br>
<br>

“1072…1073…”  

He felt the weight in both the fists that struck at air and the legs that kept his stance firm.  

*Is this enough for now?*

<br>
<br>

“What, Victor? I’m just answering some questions here.” Georg threw his hands up.  

“I refer to all of you here. *Not. Another. Word*.”  

“No need to be so glum, Vic. We’re just calling you adorable here.” Pendra patted a hand on his shoulder in consolation. “And besides–”  

“Do not try my patience, Pendra\! I said ‘not another word’\!”   

Pendra moved his hand back and uncomfortably shifted in his seat.  

“What happened back then was no matter to be defiled by your ‘jokes.’” Victor warned both him and Gehenna. “It belongs in the unsaid past, therefore, it will not be discussed any further. Continue to pry into this matter at your own peril\!”  

“Alas, a matter ‘defiled by jokes’: the unmistakable horrors of yet another tragedy.” drawled Georg, unwilling to heed the warning. “I don’t see what you’re so worried about: it’s just the past we’re speaking of here.”  

“A past none else here must know of, Georg. You know why.”

<br>
<br>

“1077…1078…”  

**THUMP.**  

Gerwyn felt his lungs burning as his pulse roared in growing agony.  

*Am I really going to end this by clenching my wretched heart in defeat again?*

<br>
<br>

As the two men stared each other down once more, the oldest finally sighed.  

“Well, alright then. You all heard the party pooper. There goes one more story I can’t share with the family.”  

“Ah, well…no worries about it, Georg.” Pendra assured, bouncing back to diffuse the tension once again. “I was gonna ask about something else, anyways.”  

“Oh? And what might that be?”  

“If you fought against Nadis in a mood where she holds nothing back, would you win?”  

“Hmm…good question.” Georg scratched his chin to muster up an answer. “If I had to guess…”  

He trailed off for a few seconds in the guise of minutes, then let his eyes open for a bit as an answer came.  

“I’d lose.”

<br>
<br>

“1082…1083…”  

**THUMP.**  

The silent air no longer surrendered to such enervated jabs.  

*Would I really lose anything if I went back to the archives and did a bit more research into other martial arts instead?*

<br>
<br>

“Now there’s something I find hard to believe.” Pendra called out.  

“And why’s that?”  

“Uh, because you’re the oldest? Even if you’re not the strongest here, I know you’d put up a fight against her\! The one time you joined the spars, it seemed like you were holding back against all of us. Even Victor\!”  

“Not to mention that you’re the only besides Gerwyn to be adept in magic from all seven elements.” Gehenna added.  

“And unlike the cripple, he’s got an actual pool to make use of them.” Mercer chimed in. “The main reason he’s holding back against us is because he’s brown nosed our father so hard, he can just take the easy road out of this and look down on us while doing it. There’s some other cheap tricks he’s got up his sleeve for it, too.”  

“I can confirm without a shadow of a doubt that two of you are on the right track and one of you was born with the name Mercer Ashwright\!” Georg clapped in mock applause.  

“Yeah, whatever; go fuck yourself, bastard.”   

“Already did, it was better on paper than in execution. Anyways…” Georg cleared his throat and continued, uncaring of the raised eyebrow Gehenna gave him. “I suppose I could put up a fight, yes, but the difference lies in what we’ve spent all these years practicing.”  

He looked back at the benches, where his other brothers were.  

“I’m listening,” said Pendra.  

“I’ve done a whole lot since the last time I left this kingdom on a journey of my own, and much more even before that. Meetings with those of renown and valor, studies of varying cultures, research into different fields, a whole lot. But I’ve rarely stuck myself in one place to refine a craft to its full potential. Nadis, on the other hand…”  

He stared back at the sparring. Nadis had taken another decisive victory, and Lily demanded yet another rematch.  

“She found her calling long ago. So she stuck to being second-to-few at it.”

<br>
<br>

“1086…1087…”  

**THUMP.**  

1100 jabs felt more and more like an acceptable place to stop.  

*This isn’t too different from how I’ve fallen off learning other weapons. My body fails me right when I feel on the right track to progress, and thus I end up in the dust of others.*

<br>
<br>

“You speak of her being an adventurer, right?” inquired Gehenna.  

“Indeed. To be careful and observant of danger in lands uncharted and know how to overcome any adversity is one of many things to have in a profession as dangerous as hers. Even with the time I’ve invested on my own adventures, it pales in comparison to what she’s accomplished both in and out of the know.”  

“Well, that much is easy to figure out. What did you say she’s called in whispers again?”  

“Eh, a couple of titles. ‘Quiet Lightning’, ‘Unzephyr’, ‘That-cobalt-bitch-with-the-spear’, oh, and my personal favorite: ‘The Silent Raven of Shinaru.’”  

“Whoa…” Gehenna and Pendra both said in unison, amazed.  

“Watch yourself with that third one.” Victor warned.  

“I dunno, that one’s not too far off from the truth.” Mercer jeered.  

“And *you* are *this close* to–”

<br>
<br>

“1094…1095…”  

**THUMP.**  

Gerwyn’s body fought the temptation to stop, unable to decide the better outcome.  

*If I can barely make it past this…could I still have the audacity to call this fist a part of my crippled heart?*

<br>
<br>

“Okay, settle down already, both of you; I didn’t come up with that anyways.” assured an exasperated Georg. “That one’s a mere throwaway from some envious folk too amusing to omit from memory. It had to be said.”   

Gehenna, ever the intrigued inquisitor, was suddenly glad Nadis’s full attention was on Lily. “So it’s safe to assume she’s never told us this as an exercise in humility of sorts?”  

“Correct again. Also, she’s not a fan of any of those nicknames. Especially the last one.”  

“What\!? Aw come on, ‘The Silent Raven of Shinaru’ sounds so cool, though\! What’s not to like about it\!? It’s not every day people call you a retainer of a god\!” exclaimed Pendra.  

“Right\!? That’s what I’ve been telling her for years, but she always responds with a glare and the possibility of stabbing my lights out. But then again…” 

<br>
<br>

“1098…1099…”

<br>
<br>

Georg paused for a moment and breathed in, as if transforming his bout of annoyance into a peaceful clarity.   

“She’d keep at it even if no one gave her any titles. That’s how dedicated she is to her job, and why I’d lose against her. To quote something I read long ago…”

<br>
<br>

Georg and Bobby West spoke of the same idea.

<br>
<br>

**“If you throw a punch and it hurts, it’s not because you got lucky.**   

**It’s because you threw that punch thousands of times.”**  

<br>
<br>

“1101\!”  

The words from *Knuckle Duster’s* author fired off a burst of energy in his veins.  

*Stop with that excuse already\! It’s pathetic and wretched\!*  

“1102\! 1103\! 1104\! 1105\!”  

His pace resumed its original focus.  

*I will make it past this, and master whatever else that book offers\! I have to\!*  

“1106\! 1107\! 1108\! 1109\!”  

It was as if he had never slowed to a crawl at all.  

*That book didn’t say a mere one thousand punches\! It was multiple thousands\!*  

“1110\! 1111\! 1112\! 1113\!”  

Perhaps the resolve lay in his blood, or perhaps the spirit of a renewed scholar.  

*So of course this isn’t enough as it is\! Just keep jabbing\! Keep going\!*  

“1114\! 1115\! 1116\! 1117\!”  

The kindled flame within his soul would not peter out as soon as it was born.  

*I won’t stop until I engrave this fist into my heart\!\!*  

<br>
<br>

“Though I guess in Nadis’s case, if you thrust a spear and it kills, it’s because you thrusted that spear thousands of times.” added Georg.  

“Damn it, I lost again\!” Lily shouted from afar, sprawled on the floor after Nadis had caught her off guard with another spear toss. “One more\!”  

And in another flash of flames and lightning, they had started another round.  

“Actually, what am I saying? ‘Thousands’ is too generous, I imagine she’s thrusted that spear more than a million times.” he corrected himself.  

“Okay…but what does that have to do with the power difference between you and her?” questioned Gehenna once again. “You’ve also likely practiced the disciplines that got you this far thousands of times.”  

“And that’s the thing: the amount of practice I’ve put into each is in the mere thousands. I’ve gotten by fine with knowledge and practice in many fields, but no matter how I combine them together, it will still pale in comparison to the power of one who has done one task millions of times.”

“1151…1152…1153\! 1154…1155…1156\!”

<br>
<br>

“As long as you do one thing and one thing incredibly well…”

<br>
<br>

“1157…1158…1159\!”

<br>
<br>

“...the rest will slowly, but surely, fall into place. That’s the difference between her and I.”  

“Then how’d you get by all these years, traveling alone?” Pendra’s curiosity was also yet to be sated, and Georg still felt the desire to indulge it.  

“Heh, that’s because–”  

“His lazy ass just started paying other people to do the work for him.” Mercer interjected.  

“Correction: I used the connections and bonds at my disposal.” Georg shut down Mercer again. “Turns out that being someone people actually want to talk to goes a long way in having help for the road. Comes without the price of gold, too.”  

“Right, nothing says likeability like popping in and out of existence for years at a time and acting like hot shit along the way. Godsdamned show-off.” Even in spite of everything that came his way today, Mercer would not fold so easily.  

“And nothing says likeability like *petulance* from a man who can’t intimidate to save–”  

“Lunch has arrived\!\!” called out a voice from the entrance.   

Three maids had arrived pushing a table with multiple bags.  

“Ah, well, we’ll have to pick up on that thought some other time, little brother. For now, lunch beckons.” said Georg.  

“Nothing says lunch like the ‘provisions’ we’re about to have.” Pendra grumbled in disappointment.   

This was far from the first time the Ashwrights had such provisions, but he had the futile hope that one day would be the last.  

<br>
<br>

“1250…1251\! 1252…1253\! 1254…1255\!”

<br>
<br>

The siblings all ate the ‘provisions’ at the training grounds, emulating the brief respite soldiers sometimes had on the battlefield. Such was tradition in Ashwright’s elite military, and by extension, royalty.  

Pendra took a spoonful of the black gruel and beans from his bowl and steeled himself for a bite.   

“Ugh, this never gets any easier to chow down.” he groaned after swallowing it.  

“Be grateful for what you have. Soldiers have these as provisions all the time. Not every meal you must consume has to be one of extravagance, Pendra.” Victor sharply lectured.   

“Yeah, yeah, you’ve said as much already. Doesn’t mean I have to like what’s being served.”  

“You will not continue such complaints if you wish to achieve the standards of a warrior.”  

“Seven alive, Vic, what’s your–”  

“Yeah, Penny, just eat your lunch and quit whining like a baby already\!” Lily suddenly chimed in.  

“Really, now?” Pendra raised an annoyed eyebrow. “I can see you retching at the food too, you know.”  

“Huh\!? No…uh…what are you talking about? This stuff’s delicious\!” She shifted her eyes awkwardly, then hurriedly scarfed more bites, trying desperately to fight against the taste. “Urk\!”  

“Yeah, sure looks delicious, doesn't it, Miss 0 to 7?” Pendra smugly grinned as he took another bite.  

“Shaddap\!\!” Lily shouted through tears of agony and more bites.  

“Remember what I said about eating and talking, you two?” Gehenna warned.  

“Idiots.” Mercer muttered as he lost himself in his own thoughts.  

<br>
<br>

Gerwyn had taken care of his situation for lunch long ago.  

“1335\! 1336\! 1337\! 1338\! 1339\!”  

*It’s a good thing those sandwiches Bethany made were filling.*  

“1340\! 1341\! 1342\! 1343\! 1344\!”  

*I’d hate to go hungry after picking up a good rhythm like this.*  

“1345\! 1346\! 1347\! 1348\! 1349\!”  

*Maybe next time, I’ll get more rations before coming here. Not like I can just go back and forth to the marketplace from here, after all.*

<br>
<br>

“Yknow, Georg, aren’t you mad at this too?” Pendra asked the eldest after finishing his portion of lunch.  

“Hm? About what? If it’s to do with Mercer, he’s still got a long way to go before he can come remotely close to my nerves.” Georg smugly replied.  

“Heard that, asshole.” spat Mercer.  

“No, not that.” said Pendra. “It’s about these ‘provisions.’ They’re still handing us this gruel even though you just got back after years of being gone\! Don’t you think this is a bad way to give someone a warm welcome?”  

“Ah, this right here isn’t a problem.” he smiled. “In fact, I find it nostalgic, in a way.”  

“Huh? What’s nostalgic about it?”  

“We used to have this gruel back when it was just me, Nadis, and Victor training with the soldiers together. And it tasted just like it did before; bitter and full of protein.”  

“And much like you, he used to be the one who’d complain about it.” added Nadis.  

“Indeed. Back then, in those days of being a spry young lad, I’d often ask why ‘healthy meals’ such as this had to taste like sewage and pisswater mixed in a bowl. For too long, I assumed it was yet another means of torture by Father’s high standards.”  

Pendra looked over to Nadis for confirmation, but she looked off to the side. A subtle, forlorn look had overcome her, but the context of what it could possibly be was far beyond him. He figured as much.  

“But as I’ve traversed this world and tasted both far better and far worse, a revelation came to me.” Georg continued. “It hit me after yet another dull trek through Ne Vu Jxa, where I had gone through a day of nothing but mountains, rocks, leaves, and more mountains.”  

“Oh, you mean that entire range around the east of Lambda? How would you both compare that to the Highlands?” asked Pendra.  

“The Highlands are far more treacherous, but the amount of mountains they have pales in comparison to the entire range of Ne Vu Jxa.” Nadis answered. “That being said, I can confirm Georg was panting and dishing complaints on the first venture we had alongside a certain party.”  

“Hey, in my defense, the mountains were hard to tell apart; I felt like I was losing my mind back then\! Especially since we had to venture there several times to chart as much of the same-looking territory as we could, and the provisions we had were close to empty. We starved, everyone starved, and the hunger nearly killed what remained of our sanity. A few lost more than that.”   

Nadis gave a small nod in confirmation. Though Georg’s tone remained casual when describing the experience, it seemed she held the memory in more somber regards.  

“The point is, when we were finished and got wasted at a bar, a thought crossed as I felt the beer pour into my system: would I have felt this same relief if the mission had been more manageable? Was it specifically because those mountains were such a pain in the ass that I could bask in the beauty behind what had been done? Before I knew it, this stray thought became a mind’s rule that I’d follow for the rest of my days. To take the good with the bad, and to enjoy the *honey after gruel*.”

<br>
<br>

“1436\! 1437\! 1438\!”

<br>
<br>

“The honey after gruel?”  

“Yes, the honey after gruel, just like this bowl right here.” he said as he took another bite out of it. After smacking his lips and wincing slightly at the taste going down, he subtly gestured at Pendra.  

“Listen well, little brother. The beauty of adventuring does not merely lie in seeing the best of this world. It comes from trudging through its worst to get to the best. It’s not about finding the sweetest honey there is to offer; it’s about eating whatever gruel you must to get there. The honey by itself merely tastes like honey, but when you take it in after bowls and heaps of this bile…”  

He chugged down the remaining gruel as if it were a bottle of wine, uncaring of the odd look Gehenna and Pendra both gave him.   

“...it tastes like the best damned thing you could ask for in Axiom.”  

“It’s not just about trudging through the worst, mind you. There’s plenty of monotony one must cover as an adventurer.” added Nadis. She frowned as she looked at her bowl. “Bland monotony, much like this gruel. At this point, it wouldn’t kill them to add *some* flavor to this protein; even one condiment won’t sacrifice the benefits.”  

“Right\!? Even just a tinge of actual honey or pepper would do.” Georg added.  

“Gods, do not encourage him, you two.” groaned Victor.  

“Encourage him with what, exactly? The *truth*?” Nadis’s voice lowered once again.  

“No, I meant with–”  

Her venomous glare shut him down immediately, so he sighed.  

“...Never mind.”

<br>
<br>

“1436\! 1437\! 1438\!”

<br>
<br>

“Now tread carefully here, little brother. This is also the look she tends to give when you mention to her one of those titles I just told you about.” Georg subtly pointed at her.  

Gehenna and Pendra both felt goosebumps stand on end at the open provocation.  

“You told them about those?” asked Nadis, raising an eyebrow.   

“Sure did, since you certainly weren’t going to.”  

Though the spectators expected another tense staredown, Nadis merely sighed and looked off to the side.  

“Well, whatever. Years ago, you wouldn’t be wrong about the *look*, but now, I don’t care.”  

“Not even about being called ‘The Silent Raven of Shinaru?’”  

“No, because that one was made by a zealot a little too grateful to me for saving her beloved once.”  

The two spectators then let out a sigh of relief.   

Lily, however, was flabbergasted yet again, and it wasn’t just from the title.  

“Yeah, I guess when you feel that good about yourself, being called ‘That-cobalt-bitch-with-the-spear’ starts to feel like a badge of honor in itself.” Mercer grumbled as he stabbed a spoon into his nearly finished bowl of gruel.  

Gehenna’s eyes widened as she turned to Mercer. “You *gutterheaded mongrel*, do not–”  

“Now that one brings back memories.” Nadis replied with a smirk. “I remember losing sleep over that one day, then making a fool out of the one who distributed it the next. Those sure were simpler times.”  

“It still surprises me how you pulled that off back then. The shift from that timid little girl you once were to now is still a mystery to me.” said Georg.  

“Is it, now? You and I both know how and why such change had to happen.”  

Mercer clicked his tongue as he resumed eating his lunch.   

Lily opened her mouth, likely to question Nadis further on the titles, but Gehenna took notice and put a quick finger up to her own lips.   

Neither she nor Pendra were prepared for such a back and forth of emotions and tension, nor did they wish to put up with any of it for the rest of the day. 

<br>
<br>

As the day of training continued, so did one lone outcast’s spar against thin air.  

“1588…1589…1590…1591\!”  

Infernal tension burst as quickly as it dissipated in one world.   

“1592…1593…1594…1595\!”  

The other held only the quiet flame of solitude.  

“1596…1597…1598…1599\!”  

One flame kept itself alive through the forge of chaos and unrest.  

“1600…1601…1602…1603\!”  

The other needed only numbers to sharpen an unseen weapon.

<br>
<br>

After yet another day of spars and gruel, the sun had finally set, and everyone was to retire for the day.  

Georg had left half an hour ago to attend ‘important business with a strategist’, yet his words still rang in Mercer’s head.  

*“I’ll need to see it in person about three extra times to truly believe you didn’t just catch lightning in a bottle.”*  

“Damn it…” Mercer muttered.  

He had just ended the day off on a victory against a now exhausted Lily, much to her chagrin. Concerned only with his remaining strength, he sauntered off to the benches to recover, and looked up at the sky.  

*The sun's going down, huh? Still reminds me a lot of…her.*  

A forlorn woman with hair the shine of gold flashed back into his mind.  

The wretched voices of his brethren in the distance dissipated it just as quickly.  

“Whew, it sure is exhausting to get back into the swing of things after two weeks of being away on other business. I sure still have an edge to sharpen.” Gehenna commented as she stretched out some aches.  

“And you will have more to re-acquaint yourself with, come tomorrow. Still, excellent work today.” praised Victor.  

“Yeah, you were super cool out there today, big sis\! We should definitely go for another round against each other first thing tomorrow\!” Lily beamed with both a certain pride and joy. Despite her exhaustion, it seemed she still had enough energy for her own praise.  

“Why, many thanks to you both. Although you’ve run yourself far too ragged for your own good, Lily. Get all the rest you need while you still can, and we’ll let the others fight in the morning, alright? I wouldn’t want to make your current injuries any worse.”  

“I can definitely keep going in the morning, but you’re right\! I’ll do just that\!” She then turned around and began shouting at the benches. “You hear that, Mercer\!? You better be ready, come tomorrow, because once I get my strength back up to full, you won’t get so lucky like you did today\!\!”  

*One of these days, I’m gonna make that little shit regret being born into this world.*  

“Now, now, Lily, let’s not antagonize the dog there; there’s still much of our own business to attend to.” Gehenna said as the two walked off.  

*Same goes for that bitch, twice over.*  

The two young sisters had left. Not long after, Nadis and Victor silently went their own separate ways. The only ones remaining in the outdoor grounds were Mercer and Pendra.  

“Well, we should probably get going, too. Unless you want to watch the sunset, but there’s a better view for that.” said his younger brother.  

“...Yeah, let’s.”  

The two had known each other well enough for less biting conversations, but Mercer had too much swirling through his mind to properly indulge in one today.  

“Good thing you got that losing streak cleared out today. Keep that up and everybody will remember how much you mean business.” Pendra encouraged.  

*Yet despite all that, I’m still weak.*   

“Memory’s not their strong suit. Least of all the commander and that little shit.” Mercer retorted.  

“Hey, c’mon, I get you’ve got your reservations against both of them, but you also can’t choose your family, y’know?” Pendra sighed out of concern.   

*What I said about Victor deteriorating is also happening with me. Loathe as I am to admit it…that bitch wasn’t wrong.*  

“Why should I bother getting along with a stubborn fool and an arrogant brat I never asked to be related to? There’s absolutely no hope of that, and I’d rather not pretend otherwise.”  

*I used to be better at Katorus. Here, it’s somehow a struggle to replicate that strength.*  

“There *is hope* if you try hard enough. Look, Mercer, I know you’ve got chances for people to respect you for who you are. You’ve got more to you than just a foul temper, and I’ve seen it firsthand myself\! But you can’t keep letting that anger squander your chances like this.”  

*And none of those people are here. No one’s going to help me sharpen my edge the way it should be. I need to get out of this damned kingdom, but…*  

“You should know that I’m in the core of my sanity when I do what it is that needs to be done.” Mercer glared back at Pendra.  

*How the hell do I do that without Victor or some other general breathing down my neck? I need access to a better ground for training myself, but what do I do to get there?*  

“That doesn’t make it better, y’know\! Listen, all you have to do is just…”  

Pendra trailed off, for he noticed someone else walking on the opposite end of the hallway.  

“Hey, that’s Gerwyn over there. Maybe we should invite him along to see the sunset.” he suggested with an earnest grin.  

Sure enough, the cripple had returned to the castle, as ragged as he did yesterday.  

He had immersed himself in yet another unrecognized book as he walked on the opposite side of the hall, likely unaware he was not alone.  

At first, Mercer went with the instinct to ignore him, but an opportunity suddenly clicked.  

An opportunity that would answer his own question.  

“Tch, let’s go. I’ve got places to be, after all…” Mercer groused as he kept walking.  

“Uh…alright then.” Pendra, unaware, followed behind closely.  

Mercer quietly closed the horizontal distance between his shoulder and the cripple’s.  

*There’s just one thing I haven’t tried yet.*
