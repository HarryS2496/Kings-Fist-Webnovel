Gerwyn’s heartbeat began to calm as he walked further down the hall.  

His legs felt the heaviest they had been in a while, and it wasn’t just from walking.   

Force of habit took them over as he trudged along the path he always took whenever he needed a respite from the pressure in this castle of dark stone.   

*Did I always have that strength in my hand?*  

He looked at his palm again; the fork came back to mind.  

*Or…did that tower do something to me?*  

He quickly crushed that thought.   

The reputation of that tower was rooted in superstition, as it was once reserved for the worst criminals found in Ashwright. He had studied it before, and many of the accounts reporting sights of “eerie noises” or ghost sightings were either lacking in evidence or debunked by mundane coincidences. Blueprints showed that no magic theory went into the construction of that tower when it was built.   

*I was shaking earlier because my mind refused to let me die.*   

He turned left to face a dimly lit tunnel with a staircase leading downwards.   

*No spirits or magic were involved, it was by natural instinct.*  

His right hand held onto the iron handrail to support his aching legs.   

As he slowly descended the steps, a third possibility came to him.  

*Perhaps it’s easy to crush a metal fork if you know how. I was clenching the thinnest part of it, after all. I’d still need some strength for steel, but–*  

His left foot gave out, and the world titled.   

**THUMP.**  

The sudden shock to the heart tightened his grip on the rail, preventing the fall.  

He heaved a sigh of relief as his left hand felt his chest, feeling an urge to chuckle.  

*Death by stairs, eh? It’d be a fitting end for this ‘crippled wretch’.*  

After 10 more cautious steps, he made it to a large wooden door below.   

Two obsidian braziers, each erupting an ethereal flame, illuminated at the sides.   

His eyes briefly shut before he slowly opened them.   

The dinner table was now far away.  

*It* was far away.  

He pushed the handle and opened the door.   

A warm glow spilled into the darkness as he pushed it.   

The door made no sound as it revealed his sanctuary in this dark, frost ridden castle.   

Ashwright’s royal library, the Ashen Archives.  

This library was a haven built from smooth marble and limestone.   

There was some space between the door and the front desk to Gerwyn’s right, where 2 of its staff were currently organizing documents and folders. On the front desk was a sign that said:

<br>

<p class="center-bold-and-italics">Every text must be tracked; come to this desk before you leave with one.</p>

<p class="center-bold-and-italics">Every text must be placed where it was found.</p>

<br>

The area beyond stretched for a league that would rival a colosseum, yet it was compact with tidy shelves. Orange lanterns draped the walls and books filled every shelf in an orderly fashion.   

He had been here many times before; on some occasions, it was impossible not to breathe in its atmosphere as if it were the first visit.   

Footsteps approached from the left. A fellow bookworm came to greet him.   

He turned and saw a small nameplate on her vested dress: Archive Master Cen Francis.  

“Ah, welcome, Lord Gerwyn. Glad to see you here once again.” she said while adjusting her gray spectacles.  

Despite her serious expression, *it* did not dwell in her eyes.   

Or perhaps he couldn’t see if *it* was there.  

*No, stop that, you fool. She’s not the same as the people above.*   

She did not even hide her freckles with makeup; such masks were unneeded in this underground abode.   

*She’s never given you a reason to doubt.*  

“It is good to see you too…Master Cen.” he nodded. His expression lightened, but restrained it, trying not to put her off with an odd smile.   

“If you are here at this time, I take it that the reunion ended not too long ago?”   

He nodded. They were still eating – but as his mother said earlier – the important part of the meeting had passed.   

“I will not ask what transpired there, then. As for what we recently acquired…”  

She took out a notepad and flipped through it, as she often did when she tried to recollect. After flipping through half its pages with her swift fingers, she frowned.  

“Unfortunately, no updates on *D-100%* or Michael Crow’s next project. That eccentric has been rather quiet for half a year now. And…”  

The frown became forlorn.  

“We still haven't found any books involving medicine or treatment for a frail heart. I express my sincerest apologies; even after all this time, we still lack recent information in the cardiovascular field.”  

“Oh…you don’t have to apologize, Master Cen.” He scratched his head and glanced away. “I stopped looking for a cure a long time ago; there’s never been much information about my…condition. It’s a rare one that’s…still being studied.”  

There was a bittersweet feeling, looking into the sorrow that briefly invaded her eyes.  

*She’s always gone out of her way to help someone like me…*  

She quickly adjusted an auburn river of hair behind her shoulders to regain composure.   

Her expression returned to its usual severity.  

“Your concern is more than appreciated. Anything else I can help you with for the night?”  

He shook his head. ”Nothing so far. Thank you.”  

“Enjoy the rest of your evening, then, Lord Gerwyn.” She bowed and then quickly walked off, likely busy with a mountain of paperwork.   

He moved on instinct; his destination for tonight was the “Combat Guides” section on the 1st floor, located near the opposite side of this facility.  

Most people, even advisors who frequented this place, still couldn’t find their way around it without help. It was common for them to end up lost in this grassland of literature, especially if they were trying to find one specific text. The shelves here were tall enough to look imposing, but short enough so that everything remained in reach. The downside was that to store all of the texts, these archives had to be wide in space and dense with 3 floors.   

*It won’t be surprising if a 4th floor or second basement gets built in a few years.*   

Despite the sections being well-organized, maps were still necessary.  

Especially so for visitors.  

*I don’t need a map.*  

Gerwyn was not a visitor.  

He had read a third of the books here, and had become familiar with every section available.  

*Traversing this place and reading its contents are my only skills…if they can even be called such.*  

His fingers ran across the spines while passing through the “Medical” section.  

It was a greeting to old friends that had not been visited in years.  

*No unfamiliar spines here; she was right.*  

The childhood memories of desperately combing through these texts were still so vivid.  

Human anatomy.   

Medicines.  

Personal accounts from renowned apothecaries.  

Surgery.   

Cardiovascular science.  

Artificial organs.  

The magic theory behind healing.  

Effects of magic on the body.   

All elaborate diagrams and words that a childhood did not need concern over.  

*Could this crippled heart be cured?*  

Yet his childhood was spent on parsing them for knowledge.  

*Master Cen and I spent years running around that question.*  

Sometimes, he did it to find answers; oftentimes, he did it to find an escape.  

*There was no cure for it back then…*   

It was far easier walking in circles than admitting to walking in circles.  

*…and there is no cure for it now.*    

All games must come to an end. The truth had to be admitted eventually.  

*My life is forever at the whims of this frail thing.*  

After an unsatisfying end to that game, there were no reasons left to keep walking.  

Yet his visits here did not cease.  

The hunger to understand more within the pages lingered, and he still wormed his way through the literature of this archive.   

Sometimes, he did it to find answers; oftentimes, he did it to find an escape.   

*Tonight is not a night to escape. Not after what I failed to do on that watchtower.*  

He had reasons to walk again; whether it was in another circle or not was unimportant.  

*That fork is a new question, and I’m going to find the answer.*

<br>
<br>

Nadis took one last sip of water out of her glass cup. It did not help her dry throat.  

The Ashwright family dinner had ended amicably.  

Too amicably.  

As the maids cleared the plates, Sherman and Beatrice bid them farewell for the night.   

*No stern parting words this time? He’s mellowed his tune.*  

Mercer was next to leave. He immediately took the opportunity to storm out of the room, grumbling something as he often did.   

“Still such a sourpuss.” Gehenna remarked while delicately wiping off her lips with a napkin. “And here I thought he’d do a better job of contemplating his losing streak on a full stomach.”   

“Or maybe he’s jealous that *someone* got to the watchtower before he could.” Pendra added. He stood up and loosened his messy ponytail, letting an unkempt cascade of red locks fall to his neck. “Whoo, I’m stuffed. Gonna have to walk this off now.”  

“Gods, I still can’t believe *he* went there.” Lily said as she pushed back her chair.   

“Oh hoh, *you* sound pretty jealous too.” Pendra grinned while near the door.  

“As if\!” Lily scoffed. She puffed her chest while striking a dramatic pose. “Personally, if I climbed that tower, I would announce exactly how difficult it was – and how I overcame it through sheer will\! I still don’t understand why *he’s* quiet about it, because I certainly wouldn’t be\!”   

*Because he and you are not the same.*  

“In other words: jealousy.” Gehenna murmured as she rose to leave.  

“Ehhhh, I dunno about ‘sheer will’.” Pendra called out, being the only audience member bothering to humor her. “You’d be more likely to piss a river halfway through, right when the voices of the damned started whispering your name. Gehenna would also agree.”  

She groaned while brushing off her dress. “By the seven, *do not* involve me with your crude jests, Pen–”  

He was already gone.   

“Oooooh, that does it\! You get back here, *Penny*\!\! I’ll teach you to stop treating me like a little kid\!\!” Lily shouted as she chased him.   

After the prodigy bolted out the door, Gehenna sighed with exasperation. “Oh, those two and their boundless energy. I don’t even want to imagine the storm they’ll bring in tomorrow’s spars.”   

*Whatever storm it is, I’ll break through the eye. That little girl needs to learn humility.*  

She adjusted her hair and looked back at the table with a smile and a bow. “Have a pleasant rest of your night, you three. And welcome back to Ashwright, Georg.”  

Georg smiled back. “Why thank you, Gehenna. It is good to be back.”  

Soon, she too had left.  

Only three siblings, the crackling fireplace, and the shuffling of silverware the maids collected remained.  

*Victor requested I stay here to help him question Georg about something ‘important’.*   

Georg knocked back his glass of wine in one gulp, exhaling a refreshed breath.   

*I’m expected to play the mediator once again. This better not be about what I think it is.*  

“I don’t see why she’s worried about their energy. They were all rather entertaining to battle earlier today.” he commented.   

Though his cheeks gained a rose tint, he did not stagger.   

“Lily's fighting style is the spitting image of our father, Mercer’s gotten more beastly, and Pendra? That little brother turned his magic into something real special. I’ve read about the magic theory – using both wind and earth to predict movement – but never thought one of our own would try and master it.”  

Victor nodded. “It is unorthodox for Ashwright’s warriors, but in this day and age, we need versatility in might. Proper discipline will set those three on the right path. Gehenna lags behind; I will not permit her to drift further.”  

“You don’t have to hide behind that scowl, little brother. I can tell you’re giddy with excitement to bully your kin tomorrow.” Georg chuckled.   

“Do not mistake my aims. I *do this* to prepare them for the trials ahead. They may despair now, but they will thank me for what I do years later.”  

*No, they won’t.*   

“Hey hey, I’m not mistaking anything here. It just so happens that there’s an open book in front of me, and the pages are written in fine ink.”  

The two brothers gazed at each other.   

The unsheathed stare that pierced versus the sheathed stare that shattered.  

Another bout of silence.   

Nadis poured more water into her cup, then Victor’s.  

He drank it all down and slammed the cup onto the table, careful not to break it.  

*Again, this isn’t a council. It’s just us.*  

“More importantly…” Victor exhaled. “Georg.”  

The eldest brother raised an eyebrow and tilted his head. “Hm?”  

She drank another sip of water to prepare for the “interrogation.”  

“Ever since you arrived back here the other day, rumors have already circulated regarding the maids. They speak of joint pains and…risque activities in…gratuitous detail. The one responsible for such is only referred to as a tall man with…exorbitant stamina, and I suspect it is you.”  

She gently set her cup down and rubbed her temple.  

*Why in the name of the gods did I sit next to these two?*   

A maid who overheard the accusation dropped a tray of plates out of shock. Thankfully, none of them broke; Ashwright’s plates were well known for their durability.  

As she hurriedly put them back together, she met Nadis’s apologetic gaze.  

They shared a similar sentiment of despair as the maid got back to work.  

Every second of silence felt more agonizing than the last.  

“Victor,” Nadis finally said with a sigh. “Correlation does not equate to causation. Loathe as I am to defend Georg, you mustn't speak on conjecture alone.”  

“And I fail to see the logic behind such conjecture.” Georg sighed along. “I’m born tall, I came here yesterday, and…that’s enough to be deemed a suspect? All I did was grace this castle with my presence; it isn’t my fault the well-endowed maids here suddenly went into heat. I know not of a spell or cologne that could do such a thing.”  

Victor slammed a fist onto the table, struggling to handle his cheeks getting redder with each second. “Numerous *hip aches* have been reported here, brother\! This needs to be taken care of before our entire staff ends up crippled f-from…from fornication\!”  

“Alas, ‘*crippled from fornication*’; what a tragic fate for our kingdom.” Georg drawled as he poured more wine into his glass. “Gods forbid a man and a woman try to handle each other’s backed-up needs while off duty.”  

After one gulp out of the glass, he subtly gestured at Victor.  

“Listen well, little brother. Whoever this rumored ‘tall man’ is, he understands common courtesy when it comes to satisfying a lady: *break* her ass until her legs forget their purpose and her eyes see the heavens. One day, you’ll understand when you travel around Axiom and finally find *yours*.”  

“You are *not* helping your own case, Georg.” Nadis cringed, still rubbing her temple.  

“What?” he laughed with a smug grin. “You know I speak the truth. You’ve been an adventurer for far longer than I, so you’ve met more folks from all walks of life.”  

*And I’d rather be on another expedition with those folks than deal with this chicanery.*  

“That I have. I can also tell you from experience that people’s preferences carry far more *nuance* than the filth you speak of. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.”  

“Well, the solution I speak of fits plenty, little sister.”   

Georg took a sip from his wine, then stopped as mischief glinted in his closed eyes.   

“Hmm, but if there really is ‘nuance’ to preferences, then how about yours? What, are you the type who prefers her men see heaven fir–”  

“How I *fuck* is none of your *godsdamned* business.” Nadis coldly declared.  

The wintry fury in her eyes froze the room.  

The fireplace and candles quivered in fear at the deafening silence.  

Victor subtly shifted his chair back in embarrassment.  

Georg remained unfazed; he continued to sip more wine.  

“Ah…so it’s not just men, then; you’ve made *women* see the heavens too. No wonder you’ve got such a quiet confidence; people of your ilk always have quite the tastes.”   

He opened his eyes and widened his grin.   

“Next time, invite me to them. I’d love to learn more about these ‘*nuances*’.”  

She saw those eyes enough times to stare back.  

*I don’t think I will, sycophant.*  

Far worse had shattered her before.  

“W-Would you two give that topic a rest already\!? You’re both missing the point\!” Victor shouted. His face burned as bright as the nearby fireplace.   

*You’re the one who brought it up, chaste commander.*  

“You’re the one who brought it up, chaste little brother.” Georg retorted as he shut his eyes again. “But fine – what *was* your point, then?”  

“My point, Georg Ashwright, is that if you’re behind these rumors, it must *cease*. Father needs all of his children – all of us – ready for harder times to come. And to do that, the two of you must play your own parts as shining examples of–”  

“Ugh, you *never change*, do you?”   

The polite smile waned. Only irritation remained as he scratched his forehead.  

Nadis got up from her seat, slowly heading for the door.  

*I already know what’s going to be said next; no need to be around for it.*  

“This is…what, the fourth time you’ve talked about us playing parts at this table? And mentioning our father’s legacy?” Georg was no longer trying to hide the indignation in his voice.   

*These two men can waste time in circles by themselves.*  

“Your little brothers and sisters tell you time and again to save these talks at the war council, yet you refuse to listen. Victor, you–”   

“What I speak is of *great importance*\! I’ll repeat it as much as I must\!” Victor sharply interrupted. “Our brethren were born carrying the weight of the Ashwright name. They must be taught how to live up to its burdens, especially when us three are united to guide those five at this reunion–”  

“*This reunion* could have been all about the fun stories about what I did in Yomi and Bastionne, with cheer and laughter embracing the table.” Georg briefly opened his eyes again, carrying his own silent contempt within them. “But no, let’s instead talk about our ‘conduct as Ashwrights’ and ‘the weight we carry for our people’. It was amusing when you said it the first time, but now it’s an annoyance even Father and Mother grow weary of. You should know already that all jokes become stale the more you repeat them in succession.”  

Victor’s fist trembled in a mixture of suppressed rage and fear.  

“Are you calling this kingdom – our legacy – a *joke*?” his sharp voice growled.  

*Actually, as payback for dragging me into this, I’ll say one last thing.*  

“The ‘joke’ he speaks of is your obstinance.” she snapped, staring him down with the same eyes she gave to Georg.  

“You dismissed it earlier, but Pendra was right. Your obsession with duty grows worse by the month, and it puts off everyone else here. Father did not set this reunion up as a meeting between the commanders of Ashwright’s army. He set it up for his family. You were not asked to do your duty, you were asked to *be a brother*. Yet here you are, conducting this…*farce* of an interrogation about a sex scandal with our maids. And for what? So you can…police our staff into chastity? So you can feel more like the sole authority of this castle? You’re eroding your mind to uphold Ashwright’s creed, and I tire of it. We all tire of it.”  

He flinched, taken aback by his older sister. “Nadis, I…”   

As he often did to stay calm as a commander, he took a sharp breath to collect himself.  

“So what if I’m not...adept at discussing carnal matters? Someone has to take care of it. These problems are weeds; they must be pulled at the root before they spread further.”   

“A garden weed over rumors, eh? It beats being a pigheaded zealot.” Georg muttered as he drank another sip of wine.  

“You will *hold your tongue*.” Victor ordered with gritted teeth.  

He turned back to her. The piercing gaze behind his stern face flickered with sorrow, but it remained firm.  

“And Nadis…you should already know why I *do this*. You heard what Father said before. Every other kingdom in Axiom pushes forward in development, while our ties with them remain frayed. We've been simmering in conflict with Lambda over those northeastern provinces for years; it’s only a matter of time before it boils over into a war. The wise elves of Xaede innovate more into magic theory and beyond, yet they refuse to work with us like in the past…because of Ashwright’s values. Our values.”  

*Yes. Because of what our values cost them.*   

Victor took another sharp breath to reinforce his armor.   

“And I do not doubt the Emperor of Yomi has plans for us as well.   

Our kingdom values strength, yet his power is said to rend the heavens.   

Father claims he alone is able to keep Yomi at bay, but he grows older while the Emperor remains youthful. That empire’s relations with Lambda and the other neutral powers are better than ours; there is a possibility our lives could be at their mercy.”  

*Yes. A possibility. One possibility.*  

“Being on guard against one of these kingdoms is already much to ask for, given our current might. But if any of them unite against us, our demise is inevitable. And I’m supposed to relax, knowing such threats loom over us? Should I just smile and remain at ease? Should I just turn a blind eye to the weeds inside this castle? Should I just ‘find a lady’ and laugh at suppertime while our walls rot and all of Axiom prepares to swallow us?”   

*Yes. Our walls still remain firm.*   

His eyes began to twitch.  

“No, I cannot afford to concern myself with such questions.   

Neither should you, Nadis.  

I *do this* because someone must teach our brethren how to stay alive.  

I *do this* because someone has to bear the armor for our people.  

I *do this*…because someone has to lead after Father is gone.  

I *do this*…because to the world’s chaos, this is my only answer.”  

*No. It’s only your escape.*  

Silence smothered the room.  

Victor slowly relaxed his guard, falsely interpreting it as agreement.   

Nadis closed the distance with quiet, deliberate steps.   

Her gaze became arctic and her tongue dripped with venom.   

“You *do this* for an excuse to stare at that *precious star* of yours. Don’t you?”  

His scowl faltered, cracked by confusion.   

A bead of sweat trickled down as his mouth became agape.   

“...What?”  

She leaned in closer.   

“Go ahead then, *Commander Victor*.   

Stare at that *star* all you like.   

Learn what it will do to your *sight*.”

<br>
<br>

Below the castle and inside the Ashen Archives, Gerwyn had reached its other end.   

*Never thought I’d come back to the “Combat Guides” section.*   

He was greeted by a wall of shelves he also knew too well.   

Starting from the left of the wall, his soft fingers greeted more old friends.  

*Take your time with each shelf. Maybe there’s a new one you just haven’t seen yet.*  

The temptation to reminisce with them came again.  

Manuals and philosophies behind swords, axes, spears, bows, and the plethora of more obscure weapons were also a constant in his childhood.   

A plethora of knowledge on the many ways to take a life with steel, yet he couldn’t–  

*No, now’s not the time for that. Get to work.*  

He took another breath and traced the shelves at a slower pace.  

*If I crushed that fork with some unknown technique, then maybe it’s my body trying to tell me something.*   

No new books for axes and swords. He moved onto the next shelves.  

*This is going to be a rather esoteric subject to look into. I’ll have to find a guide involving grip strength or other internal forces within the hand.*  

No new entries on the bow. He skimmed through “*Behind the Arrow*” to see if he had overlooked something relating to grip strength – but alas, nothing.  

*If I find nothing of the sort…then maybe I’ll scour through the “History” section on the second floor. Some texts there provide occasional insights into combat.*   

Old friends to skim, nothing to be gained.  

*It wouldn’t be a surprise if a text there described the history of forks.*   

Some new entries on the art of katana forging, but nothing else worth noting.   

*Perhaps I should have asked Master Cen if she knows a book like that exists here.*   

More old friends to skim, nothing at all to be gained.  

*No, I’d sound delirious. ‘Hello, Master Cen, I crushed a fork earlier today and now I need a book that shows me everything there is to know about one.’ Like that could ever be excusable to utter into this world, you insignificant little–*  

His fingers stopped at the texture of an unfamiliar spine.  

After a brief pause, he pulled it out.   

This book wasn’t here during his last visit.  

“*Knuckle Duster \- A Guide to Boxing.*” he whispered the title.   

*Hand-to-hand combat here isn’t taught beyond basic self defense, so it’s unusual for a guide to an obscure martial art to be in these archives.*   

His eyes scanned the shelf to catch any other unusual texts like it.  

*The guides here have mostly been about weapons made in steel.*   

He looked back at the book, now fixated on the author’s name.  

“Written by…*Bobby*…*West*?” he whispered.   

The cadence of it was alien to him.  

*That’s not a name you’d find anywhere in Axiom.*  

As he flipped through the first few pages, more oddities began to show.   

*This isn’t parchment…and these words aren't ink.*  

The pages felt unnaturally smooth; the lettering looked too clean.   

One of the first pages showed a black-and-white diagram of a man with raised fists.   

*These…lifelike illustrations look too good for how many of them there are.*  

Numbers and arrows encircled to show the nuances of his pose.  

Directly below it was a description:

<br>
**First Step: The Stance**

The fundamental start to every martial art is the stance. This is the first step to readying your fists for a fight.

1 . Stand with your feet about 1.5 shoulder-width apart.  
2 . Put your dominant foot behind (right if right-handed).   
3 . Bend your knees lightly.  
4 . Keep your heels slightly off the ground; stand on the balls of your feet.  
5 . Put your lead shoulder slightly forward.   
6 . Tuck your chin.   
7 . Keep your elbows tight to the ribs.  
8 . Put your hands up and thumbs outside your fists.

<br>
Gerwyn was surprised at how succinct this manual was.   

*Some of the other guides here could learn a few things from this Bobby West fellow. They take five pages to describe what this does with one.*  

No flowery prose.   

No incessant philosophical musings.   

Just instructions.  

*This aligns pretty well with what I’m researching. After all, the techniques shown in it rely on the strength of my hands.*  

With a brief smirk, he closed the manual and carried it in his right hand.   

*If I could crush a fork…what would happen if I used a fist?*  

The left continued to scan and trace the shelves.  

*This kingdom takes great pride in how their steel is crafted in blades. To pursue a path that does not involve their steel is to forsake the pride and honor that comes with being an Ashwright warrior. I’d be defying traditions once again if I became an artist of boxing. My lack of practice in even the sword and dagger already goes against what the rest of my family stands for…but then again, it’s not like my condition gave me a–*  

A bitter chill pricked his fingers, warning him of an ominous presence.   

His eyes darted to the left as he staggered back.   

Then, a sigh of relief.  

“Oh, it’s just you.”  

The source of the chill was a massive double door of metal and obsidian he had absentmindedly touched.   

On both sides were two lions roaring from below and two ravens leering from above. To the door’s right was an old plate bolted into the wall that read: “DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT ROYAL PERMISSION.” A grand lock and chain was wrapped around its two knobs.  

This door too, was an old friend of his. Though he had seen it many times, it never ceased to unnerve him with its imposing presence.   

*I know there’s no spell behind it. Master Cen said as much.*   

*It’s a cold door in a warm world. That’s why it always throws me off.*  

“You’re lucky I still don’t have the right to see what’s behind you,” he muttered to the door. “It'd be lovely to know if you have something similar to what I’ve got here. Maybe this is exactly what your forbidden tomes look like.”  

The door did not respond.   

“Fine then, keep those secrets as you always do. This isn’t over.”  

Gerwyn suddenly realized he was talking out loud.  

Nobody was around to see him, but he walked away from the door in worry and shame.  

*What a life you lead, Gerwyn Ashwright. You can’t keep it together when at a dinner table with your flesh and blood, but you’ll talk to doors and call books your friends.*  

A sigh almost escaped, but it was soon replaced by a yawn.  

*It’s been a long day, so I should retire for the night.*   

*If I stay near this door too long, I may actually become delirious.*  

*There’s always another day for research here.*  

His aching legs began to depart.  

On the long trek back to the entrance, he looked at the book in his hands once more.  

One more question came to him as he gripped its otherworldly texture.  

*Just where did this come from…and who brought it here?*

<br>
<br>

Ten minutes had passed since Nadis had left the dining room.  

The aftermath of Victor’s “interrogation” did not surprise her in the slightest, but the stinging of tensions still remained.   

The only cure was yet another walk around this dark castle she once spent her life in.   

It had been years since she left this place behind to become an adventurer.   

Occasional and infrequent visits were all she gave back to it for a time.  

This current visit was the longest one yet, for the times were changing.  

Axiom was changing.  

She had changed so much from when she left home.   

Yet the stone walls had not changed.  

The maroon carpet had not changed.  

The statues of Ashwright’s champions to the sides had not changed.  

The conversations, no matter how much she wished otherwise, had not changed.  

*I wonder if Victor stares at these to practice that scowl of his. He looks more like them with each passing week.*   

Suddenly, she picked up the faint sound of murmurs across the halls.  

Coming back to herself, she quieted her steps and closed in on the source, observing from a corner.  

Two maids were whispering to each other.   

*These two were at the dinner earlier. I imagine they’re talking about that scandal.*  

“...it was in Lord Gerwyn’s hand, Frue. I swear by the seven\!” one maid said hushed.  

*Wait…Gerwyn? What could he have done to get their attention?*  

“There’s no way, though, right? You’re seen how that prince is skin and bones. Maybe you just need more sleep, Jamie. Your eyes seem exhausted.” the shorter maid replied in a less hushed voice as she wiped her glasses with a cloth.  

“Keep your voice down, Frue\!” Jamie’s voice, though fearful, remained low. “I’ve been getting better sleep these days; I can tell what the difference is between a trick of the eyes and a real object.”  

“Hmm…you don’t look that much different to me.” Frue said as she put her glasses on.  

“Then how in the *name of the gods* do you explain–”  

Nadis cleared her throat, startling the two.   

They immediately bowed, Frue one time out of courtesy and Jamie five times out of fear.  

“What can we help you with, Lady Nadis?” Frue politely asked.  

“Nothing important, though I heard you both mentioning Gerwyn. I also know you both were at tonight’s dinner. Did either of you see something from him?” Nadis replied with an unchanging composure.  

“...You might as well tell her.” Frue said, turning to Jamie.  

“A-Alright, well…u-um…” Jamie patted her uniform and took a deep breath to keep herself together. “We mentioned him because…he had this in his hand earlier.”  

She pulled out a wrapped cloth from her front pocket and presented it with both hands.   

*What the–*  

In the cloth was a metal fork, bent twice around the middle.  

Nadis took it from the maid’s hands and observed the dent further.  

*Ashwright steel doesn’t bend like this. Not even against magic.*  

“And you’re sure you saw him gripping this?” she asked.  

“Yes, my lady.” Jamie’s face spoke no lies.  

“I’ll hold onto it. Avoid any further trouble by mentioning this to no one.”  

They both nodded in unison, seemingly aware of the weight behind this incident.    

“Oh, and Jamie, was it? Make sure you get at least seven hours of sleep a day. Frue, see to it that she does. Good night to you both.”  

They both bowed, though a blush spread across Jamie’s freckled cheeks.  

“It shall be done.” Frue said with a smile. “Have a pleasant rest of your night, my lady.”  

Nadis walked off, leaving the two maids to retire as well.  

“...Oooh, is that swooning I see on your adorable face?” Frue teased.  

“S-S-Shut up\! It’s nothing, I didn’t know…”  

Their whispers became fainter as she walked away.   

She looked at the fork again, this time with more questions swirling in her head.  

*The only way this dent could have been made is with proper grip strength in a good hand. But…Gerwyn? He doesn’t have the muscle or build to pull this off…or does he?*  

Her hands, slightly trembling, wrapped the cloth around it and put it in a side pocket.  

*If I knew something this bizarre would happen, I would have sat around him instead of next to Father and Victor. It was to command no attention, but I couldn’t see what he saw at the table.*  

She looked through a window and up at the half-moon, seeking an answer in its light.  

*What did you leave behind on that watchtower, Gerwyn?*  

Apprehension became curiosity.  

*And what followed you back down?*
