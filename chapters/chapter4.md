“Lovely morning we're having, eh, little brother?”  

**THUMP.**  

Gerwyn’s entire body was petrified by the tall figure before him.   

Even in broad daylight, Georg’s shadow exposed no humanity.  

The polite smile held no warmth; it only masqueraded it.  

To face him here was an unexpected trial confirming the worst of his fears.  

*Why are you–*  

“You’re likely wondering why I’m here, right? Well…” he scratched his chin to search for the answer to a question unsaid. “Part of it’s because your twin sister had to lump me in the same camp as our *commander* the other day. I guess my Ashwright blood couldn’t let that stand for long.”   

**THUMP.**  

Slight irritation serrated in his voice as he mentioned Victor indirectly.  

Gerwyn suddenly recalled Gehenna’s words at yesterday’s dinner.  

*“He just climbed a tower that you and Georg cower in fear of, can’t you praise him for that instead? For a change, he accomplished something you didn’t.”*  

A bead of sweat trickled down his temple.   

*Why would you go this far?*  

“Besides, who would laze around when the sun’s shining upon our homeland like this? Harsh snowfall and frosty clouds have always been this kingdom’s domain, so I welcome a change of pace with open arms. Certainly makes this summit less…*macabre*.”  

**THUMP.**  

Gerwyn shifted left, inching away from the door behind him.   

Each step pricked like rustic nails underfoot.  

The pain worsened with each second of silence.  

*How long are you going to be here?*  

“Whew…” Georg exhaled as a breeze ruffled his hair. “Nadis wasn’t kidding. This place really is good for some peace and quiet. I’m not sure what stopped me from coming here earlier. Perhaps it’s because I’ve been through this song and dance before, but the terror these ancient paths bring doesn’t hit like it used to. When it comes to conquering these places, you get used to gambling your life away. And to gamble your life away…you need *courage*.”  

**THUMP.**  

*What courage?*  

*It* siphoned whatever scraps Gerwyn could still constitute as “courage.”  

“I wonder why no good tales ever come from this place? Ashwright lives and dies by a rather brazen creed, yet nobody’s bothered to spread a rumor about it being ‘the ultimate test of a warrior’s spirit’ or some other poetic earwax. None talk of the beauty in seeing the domain and beyond from so high up.”   

Georg shrugged while resting his back on the edge.  

“Then again…”  

His eyes opened and stared directly into Gerwyn.  

“...there’s few who walk up this tower, and fewer who walk back down.”  

**THUMP.**  

*It* roared in his eyes and pierced with a thousand knives.  

Gerwyn could only scream silently as his sight inverted.   

Black became white.  

White became black.  

**THUMP.**  

His body and heart were stuck halfway between collapsing and standing.  

“If you already knew that, though, that begs the question…”  

The thousand knives twisted into him like keys unlocking a door of skin and bones.  

“Why did you come back here…*little brother*?”  

**THUMP.**  

He could no longer stop the urge to clench his heart.  

The world blurred into a mess once again.  

Years later, the agony *It* left in his black eyes did not change.  

Gerwyn opened his mouth and–  

**THUMP.**  

It was forced shut just as quickly.  

*I can’t speak.*  

His knees fell to the floor, finally unable to handle the overwhelming pressure.  

*And even if I could…what do I say?*  

**THUMP.**  

Georg took the silence as an opportunity to turn around and look back at the horizon. He shut his eyes as he slicked back his hair as black as midnight and adjusted his gloves.  

“Hmm…you don’t know, eh? Well…that’s fine for now. You’re still far too young to know all the answers yet, but at least you’re making an effort outside that library.”   

He stepped onto the brick rail and turned back to face Gerwyn again.   

**THUMP.**  

Another chilling wind struck the two brothers, then it enveloped the eldest like an invisible shroud and emanated a sinister pressure.   

The long shadow below him began to distort and shrink.  

“I’d love to chat longer, since we’ve got more catching up to do. But…business beckons.”  

He gave a two-finger gesture and hopped off the rail.  

“Farewell.”  

**THUMP.**  

Instinct fired his body up again and told Gerwyn to give chase.  

He ran towards the edge and looked below to see–  

**THUMP.**  

*He vanished.*  

Georg was nowhere to be found.  

**THUMP.**  

Looking down at the view below again made him feel violently ill.  

He stepped back and collapsed onto the floor, staring up at the sky.  

**THUMP.**  

*That was a warp spell, likely using some combination of wind and darkness.*  

His entire body shook, unable to soothe the violent heartbeat that kept it alive.  

It did not calm even when the world around him began to make sense again.  

**THUMP.**  

Whether it was a family reunion or an adventure, *It* remained one step ahead of him.  

After far too many hoarse breaths to count, his weak voice came back to him.  

“What do you want from me…Georg?”

<br>
<br>

Gehenna let out another yawn as the current spar neared its end.  

“Deriyaaa\!\!”  

A sudden yet fierce blow from Victor disarmed Pendra, sending his axe flying into the sky. Another swift motion brought the commander’s greatsword up to the jester prince’s neck.  

*Unfortunate, Penny. You got carried away again.*  

“Y’know, Vic, you seem more pissed than usual.” He wiped the flood of sweat from his brow. “Did someone put hairs in your breakfast this morning?”   

“You rely too heavily on magic and bravado.” stated Victor flatly. “In battle, your main concern must be on finding the quickest way to cripple and subdue the enemy, and prediction magic allows you to do such with ease. Use it only when the time is right; do not waste your pool on these games.”   

“Uh, that…doesn't answer my question.” replied a perplexed Pendra as he ruffled one side of his hair. Then he put a hand to his palm, as if he came to a new realization. “Ah, I see what this is about now. You got into a fight with Nadis over breakfast earlier, told her not to eat too much protein because she was getting closer to outmuscling you, and now–”  

“Go sit down, Pendra\!\!” Victor shouted.   

The mention of Nadis’s name had struck a nerve in him.  

“Okay, fine, sheesh.”  

As Pendra walked off, he caught the axe as it fell back down to earth. The sheer force of its fall made him flinch a little, but he kept his balance and latched it back to his belt while flashing a smug grin to his siblings. His reception was an irritated click of the tongue from Mercer, a jealous scowl from Lily, and soft clapping from Gehenna and Nadis.  

“Gehenna.” Victor called out. “You’re next.”  

His glare told her she was going to be at the field for much longer today.  

She got up from her seat and gestured to Pendra.   

He didn’t hesitate to plop down on her seat as she walked to the sparring grounds.  

“Was I right, Nadis?” Pendra asked as soon as he sat down.  

“I wish.” she sighed.   

Victor stared Gehenna down as she stood on the other side of the grounds.  

“To make up for your tardiness and your two week absence, I will not hold back against you this time. Your reflex against Mercer’s foul play shows you still have a sharp edge, so I will expect much from you. Do not hold back.” he commanded while holding his sword up.  

“Oh trust me, I had no plans to.” Gehenna smirked as she sharply drew her wooden knife and flicked her shining hair. Victor flinched a little as he looked at her.  

*Good. My hair’s catching him off guard. Just as planned.*  

“Come, then\!” Victor declared. The duel began.   

Victor took the initiative with a quick swing, but Gehenna sidestepped and leapt in.   

Before she could get close, he turned his body to protect himself with another swing, forcing her to step back.  

An expected exchange.  

Unlike her two brothers, her wooden knife didn’t have the luxury to trade blows with the big hunk of wood he swung in his hands.   

*I don’t have the luxury to exchange blows with that hunk of wood like the rest of my kin.*  

He threw out two fierce side slashes and an overhead, but her weaving did not waver.  

Before he could throw a fourth, her hair made him flinch again.   

Going through with his original plan would have resulted in a foolish loss.  

Experience and instinct compelled him to quickly step back and take a defensive stance.  

*These battles won’t sharpen my edge, but my footwork instead.*  

She dashed to the side and feinted a knife toss, but it wasn’t fooling his sharp eyes.  

He slashed again as she took another opportunity to close in.  

She sharpened her eyes as the swing forced her to step back.  

This time, the memory of his greatsword’s exact range came back to her.  

*But that’s fine. He needs multiple strikes to win.*  

Pendra’s earlier method wasn’t just an act of tomfoolery.   

It was another strategy, and she felt no remorse in stealing it.  

A smirk almost caught her lips as she took her stance again.  

*All I need is one.*

<br>
<br>

By the time Gerwyn regained control of his body, he had lost track of the time.   

Apparently it had been enough for his stomach to grumble again.  

The sky was still the bright blue it had been this morning, yet the light did not embrace.  

Parts of his body ached from lying on solid stone for too long.   

*Do I even want to get up?*  

**THUMP.**  

It was stuck halfway between paralysis and apathy.  

The worst of his fears in the last place he expected had come true, after all.  

*That won't be the last time I see him. He’ll probably come back here out of boredom.*  

**THUMP.**  

The last time he had seen those eyes that shattered was a memory he smudged apart to keep himself sane.  

Even after telling himself not to feel anything, *It* always came back to him.  

*I could just lie here for the rest of my life.*   

*It* would continue to follow him no matter where he went in this kingdom*.*  

*No one would even bother going up here to find the body.*  

Even in the last place he hoped to call a haven, *It* wouldn’t even allow him that solace.  

*Besides, this view of the sky’s a better last sight than those streets below.*  

**Thump.**  

Yet, something in him refused.  

Perhaps this was the earlier dream that he couldn’t get out of his head.  

Perhaps this was the rush of blood that came when he crushed the fork yesterday.  

Perhaps this was the survival instinct that prevented his fall yesterday.  

Perhaps this was a simpler instinct that craved the taste of a sandwich.  

Or perhaps this was another feeling he knew not how to describe.   

Whatever this was, a fire suddenly lit up in his heart.  

**Thump.**  

*Get up.*  

His fingers twitched, bringing life back to his hands.  

**Thump.**  

*Get up.*  

As they pushed back into the ground, their blood flow extended back to his arms.  

**Thump.**  

*I didn’t climb all this way just to end it. So get up.*  

Despite what little strength was in his arms, they had enough to help him sit upright.  

**Thump.**  

*If you want this adventure to be ambitious, lying here won’t make it one. So get up.*  

The blood flow returned to his knees, and he drew them in to stand back up.  

It had taken far too long, but Gerwyn recovered from yet another loss.  

“Now then…” he muttered.  

His stomach growled again.   

“First comes lunch.”  

Unlatching the satchel around his belt, he brought out both the other sandwich and *Knuckle Duster*, then leaned against the wall next to the door.   

Reading while standing up was no talent of his, but it was better than letting the stone lull his legs back to sleep.  

He sighed in relief upon seeing the sandwich and the manual unharmed.   

One hand unwrapped the egg and vegetable sandwich, and he bit into it.   

The other opened the book to the first 2 pages: the foreword. An overlooked section.  

The page on the left showed a piece of art unlike anything he had seen before.   

No, to call it a piece of art would be the incorrect label for it. It was too pristine, too unidentifiable to include in the foreword of a combat manual.  

*What…am I looking at?*  

A pale man and a tan woman, each with one arm around each other. The hints of defined muscle underneath their slim builds was enough evidence to tell Gerwyn these two were experts at their craft.  

The man’s smirk was as encouraging as it was confident.  

The woman’s beaming smile could light up a room with ease.   

His eyes darted around the page for a quick answer and found a caption at the bottom of the piece: 

<br>

***“Me and my beautiful girlfriend, Akira Shigure.”***

<br>

*Okay, so that man is Bobby West, and the woman is his lover. I figured that much.*   

As he looked back at the piece, he took in the perplexing attire they wore.  

*Fashion isn’t a subject I’m literate in, but I’ve never seen clothes like this before.*   

Bobby’s hair was a smooth river of golden blonde, tied into a ponytail. His face told a mysterious story, holding a cross scar on the left cheek and dark glasses that made his eyes unseen. Though they had the frame of glasses, the lenses they carried had the same darkness as the sun visors worn by the occasional Ashfolk battle mage.   

*And this scene looks far too clean to be made of paint. There's no visible streaks or subtle blotches here, either. It’s almost like their entire being was captured in one moment and put as the piece. Artists all over Axiom would kill for the technique that replicates this.*   

The man in the piece wore a long and unbuttoned olive coat, except there were no visible buttons for holding it together, revealing a white shirt. There was instead a sharp, patterned edge at the inside end of the jacket. A large hood rested at the back of the coat, with an unusual mane of fur at its edges. The fabric of the coat was just thin enough to discard softness, but thick enough to look like his armor against the cold. The cuffs of the coat had been long worn out, likely from age and close attachment.  

*Clothes aside, I can’t figure this man out. What’s behind those dark glasses? And…what’s with all the pockets on his coat? That many could make it useful as a second satchel, but I could also see Gehenna freaking out over its ‘lack of elegance.’*  

The thick white shirt he wore underneath had a peculiar design featuring a black rhombus with a black circle at each of the 4 vertices. Gerwyn's squint slowly became a wide look as it caught every bizarre detail.  

The northern circle depicted a tortoise with a serpent for a tail and a pitch black shell that carried an indestructible shine, The two were locked in a furious staredown as raging waters rose around them.   

*Are those depictions of Axiom’s seven gods? No, definitely not, they have to be something else entirely. I mean, the turtle, the snake, and the waters look just as furious as Neidhart, but no one would ever be caught dead associating his likeness with those two animals. In fact, if wind of this depiction was ever caught before, there’d also be a fable about him tormenting the artist who dared to compare him to a “land-dwelling-stain”.*  

The western circle depicted a pure white tiger with pitch black scar-stripes across its fur. It fiercely bared fangs as sharp and cold as steel while discharging lightning as if it were armor.   

*This makes a little more sense. Shinaru is the god of lightning and battle, and they both have scars galore. But this beast’s lightning is ash-gray instead of gold, and it looks a bit too ready for a fight. The god by comparison is often calm unless provoked, and out of all the myths I’ve read, I can count about four times he’s ever been furious.*  

The eastern circle depicted a dragon with scales the color of jade and azure, a snake-like body, and four pristine claws. The dragon gave a calm yet deadly glare as an energetic wind and mist enshrouded its being like a veil.  

*Dragons are never associated with the seven. Nobody would dare.*  

The southern circle depicted a vermillion pheasant with long, aged legs the color of golden oak. As the majestic bird spread its massive wings to reveal the radiant flame-like plumage within its span, it unleashed an inferno so violent and bright, Gerwyn almost flinched from looking at it.  

*And Zaiklonael is sometimes called the Avian Lord. His pure winds pair well with fire, but he’s never shown as an active creator of it. That’s Anba’s job.*  

In the white center of the rhombus were four black symbols he could barely make out, surrounded by a faint, earthly aura: 

<br>

**中心黃龍**

<br>

Gerwyn did not recognize these letters. No language or ancient characters recorded into Axiom’s history had ever shown him what the symbols were, or what they could possibly represent.  

*There are no records of a mythos or faith showing anything close to this, not even in the realms of obscurity. Some would even twist their throats to call this shirt a campaign of heresy.*  

Though the piece showed both of them from head to torso, the bottom of its frame gave a glimpse of his jeans, showing what appeared to be slash marks arranged like stripes.   

Gerwyn snapped out of awe, and briefly hung the sandwich in his mouth to run a finger around the piece.   

*And this isn’t a hallucination.*   

The foreign yet sharply cold texture of the clean pages reminded him as much.  

*What I’m seeing is what I’m getting.*  

He put the sandwich back in his hand and directed his focus back to the “beautiful girlfriend” next to Bobby.   

Akira’s natural face told another unknown story with the two scars under her left eye. No cosmetics embellished the story to obtain beauty. Gerwyn couldn’t tell what exactly it was, but he saw something in her sharp eyes that told him she had seen much from the world, both in good and evil. Yet her unbothered smile still shined through the page.  

*How do these two manage to look that happy? Well, okay, the answer’s obvious, Gerwyn: they're a couple.*   

Black appeared to be the main theme of her appearance and attire. Her short hair, laced with white at the ends, was neatly trimmed for her pierced ears to be half visible. Her coat was much shorter than Bobby’s, yet the inside end still had the same patterned edge as his. Two thick white stripes ran across the sleeves and next to the inside end. The shirt she wore was short enough to cover her supple chest and expose her chiseled midriff. Her blue shorts, or what little Gerwyn could see of them thanks to the frame of the piece, stood out amidst the black.   

*Bobby certainly has reasons to call her “beautiful.” But…what’s that on her body?*  

What was most peculiar, though, were the markings around some parts of her body. They were blades that curved and flowed like the wind, and they ran from her arms to the outside of her abs to her legs.   

*None of those marks seem to be a sigil or a component of a magic circle, either. I’ve heard of this form of art being common among the Highlanders, but what they normally depict is far different.*   

Whatever they were, the placement of them was precise enough to let her muscle and tones shine even further.  

The gravity of the piece’s details became heavier the more Gerwyn looked at it.  

*Well, I know one thing for sure now. If I crossed one of these two wrong, they’d both put me in my grave with their bare hands. But for some reason…*  

His hand checked on the pulse, which remained stable.  

*I don’t feel scared.*   

Perhaps the answer lied in their happiness as it permeated the page.  

*Can two people really become this happy from a relationship? I’ve seen it in many a chronicle, but is it possible in reality too?*  

His thoughts wandered back to the dream before this morning, then to the wolfish grin Shenael always had.  

*Yeah, right. Like that’s ever gonna happen.*  

Not wishing to dwell on worth, his focus readjusted to the next page on the right.   

A short passage of pristine lettering greeted him.

<br>

**I dedicate this to Akira, the lovely goddess of my life, who helped me bring this together as I taught her the arts within the pages. Her face is beet red and she’s slapping me on the back right as I type this part out.**  

**I dedicate this to my mother, who always held me at the best of times and the worst of times. She deserved a better son that brought her no pain, so each step I take is redemption for her.**  

**I dedicate this to anyone else besides my father, a sniveling coward who said I’d never amount to anything right before chasing a golden kingdom he’ll never smile at.**

<br>

**No matter how many weapons there are in this world, few are like the human body itself.**  

**Sure, a knife’s an easy killing weapon to hide in your pocket.**  

**Sure, a gun scares people shitless when you point it at them.**   

**Sure, a nuke puts a country at another’s mercy just by existing.**  

**But ask yourself this:**  

**Are you still a thug when your knife gets disarmed?**  

**Are you still feared when your gun runs out of ammunition?**  

**Are you still the president when the red button malfunctions?**  

**Who are you when nothing’s left?**

<br>

*Okay…I can understand knives, considering how useful they are for thieving and assassinations. But…guns? Nukes? A red button? What is he talking about? And what could they possibly do that would make them more practical to mention than a sword or spear?*   

A bite of the egg sandwich helped keep Gerwyn’s pile of questions under control.   

*The right spell from the right mage can also put a country at another’s mercy. Since he never mentions that, I can assume no knowledge of magic exists in the remote land he’s from.*  

Another bite helped him digest the author’s last question.  

“Who am I…when nothing’s left?”

<br>

**Since before man evolved from apes, using your own body to strike has always done wonders.**  

**Even in the modern day that considers it all a sport, it still makes blood fly like nothing else.**  

**As Mike Tyson famously said:**  

**“Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.”**  

<br>

Another pile of questions, another bite into the sandwich.   

*Mike Tyson? Who in the seven is that? That name’s never touched any pages in Axiom, yet he speaks the quote like it’s a carving in history.*  

Gerwyn looked up to the blue sky, then let out a sigh before turning to the next page.  

“And who in the seven are you…Bobby West?”

<br>

**Seriously, it’s true.**  

**You can analyze all you want about how you’re gonna beat someone’s ass, but even one punch to the head can shut that swansong down.**   

**That’s not just a figurative metaphor, I know from firsthand experience.**  

**I’ve studied martial arts – boxing, kickboxing, karate, muay thai, MMA, etc.**   

**I’ve lived on the streets and in the ring for far too long.**  

**There’s always chaos beyond the glitz and glamour.**  

**There’s always legends that come and go.**  

**There’s always people who see the winner as king.**  

**There’s always talk of the victories and streaks that attract the eyes on the throne.**  

**There’s always cheers to the bleeder.**  

**But few speak of the bleeding.**  

**Few speak of the times you see death’s door.**  

**Few speak of the agony from both winning and losing.**  

**Few speak of the throne as a frail chair.**  

**Knowing this, I still chose to write this book.**  

**And I bet you’re asking one thing right now: why?**

<br>

*I’ve asked far more than ‘one thing’ here, but yes, that’s correct.*

<br>

**Because my fists are me.**  

**My will and heart are my fists.** 

<br>

Gerwyn raised his eyebrows and took the final bite.   

No morsel remained. 

<br>

**They’re all I need to answer the pain of my friends with kindness and the evils of my enemies with violence.**   

**So I wrote this to tell you how to do the same.**  

**You’ve got hands. You’re holding this book with them right now.**   

**And you can learn how to prevail in a fight with just those fists.**  

**Once you do, you won’t need a knife or a gun to prove yourself.**  

**It won’t be an easy road, though. The human body only gets stronger with consistent repetition and exercise.**   

**If you throw a punch and it hurts, it’s not because you got lucky.**   

**It’s because you threw that punch thousands of times.**  

**And if you’re eventually planning to fight others, you’ll find many who surpass you. If you want to win against them, you’ll first have to learn how to lose.**   

**To fall and get back up is just a part of the process in bettering yourself.**  

**But hey, that goes for any skill worth having, right?** 

<br>

The rhetorical question immediately prompted an answer, even with the wind as his one lone compatriot.   

“That’s true, but…”  

His hand that once held the sandwich hovered over his heart yet again.  

*How do I prove I can use my fists when my heart is like this? It was the same reason I couldn’t–*  

A stray sunray suddenly caught him off guard and brought him back to the book. The fresh sunlight shined on the last lines in the afterword.

<br>

**If you want to take that first step towards this road, all you need to do is turn the page, and dust those knuckles.**

<br>

Bobby’s final words finally brought him away from the hard stonewall his back had ached over for too long.   

*I’ve wasted enough time getting stuck on questions without an answer.* *And none of them relate to what I actually came here to do.*   

To properly recollect, he turned the pages back to the diagram showing the stance.  

*Right, that’s how it went. Good thing it’s short enough to easily remember.*  

He turned to the next page.   

The diagram showed the man throwing a punch. 

<br>

**Second Step: The Jab**  

1 - Kick off your rear foot and put your weight on the front foot.  

2 - As you kick off, quickly extend your arm straight ahead.   

The strongest point of your fist is the joint between your pointer and middle fingers.  

Be aware of your shift in weight as you extend your arm, as it will bring your torso forward. Make sure your weight does not make you lean too far in.  

3 - Turn the front knee inwards a little as you finish shifting your weight.   

This will allow smoother control over your weight.  

4 - Retract your arm back to stance. The timing for this lies in the snap reaction your arm makes as you quickly extend it.  

This snap is the key to sharpening your fist and yourself.

<br>

He threw his arm out as quickly as he could. It gave back a small jolt.  

*Sure enough, it does give a snap reaction.*   

*Ok, time to put this into action. First comes the stance…*  

He went through one step of the process at a time.  

*Feet just a bit more than shoulder width apart…right foot behind…*  

The unfamiliar discomfort slowed down his steps, as if his body was dying to ask: *“Gerwyn, what in the seven are you doing?”*  

*Bend the knees…stand on the balls of your feet…*  

“Uh…”  

*Left shoulder forward…elbows close to ribs…tuck the chin…*  

This was unlike any other weapon stance he had attempted and abandoned.  

*Hands up and thumbs outside fists.*  

“Can I even move around like this?”  

There was no mirror to know he was on the right track.   

*Ok, let’s try punching. If it’s still uncomfortable, I’ll rework my position.*  

He threw a quick punch; the jolt felt a little sharper.   

Another quick punch, this time while turning his leg inward.   

*That definitely felt lighter.*  

Another few punches. The timing was slightly better, but his fist still looked weak.  

And none of them were going straight to the invisible target in front of him.  

*How do I know if this is right? Do I just have to feel it out?*  

He licked his dry lips and recalled the comforting taste of the egg sandwich he just ate.  

*Think back. Repetition doesn’t just strengthen the human body.*  

Another attempt at a jab, this time even quicker.  

“1…”  

*Think back to the sandwiches. Bethany didn’t get lucky when she made those.*   

Another jab, this time with his left. It felt just a little closer to the target.  

“2…”  

*Those were sandwiches she made hundreds – no, thousands of times.*  

Two jabs with both. The numbers gained momentum as they became his only solace.  

“3…4…”  

*So I’ll do the same with these fists.*

<br>
<br>

Gehenna continued to dance in and out of Victor’s range.  

His swings grew faster and sharper with each passing second.  

While she had only fought one battle today, he was fighting two.  

The first was the battle against her.   

The second was the battle against accumulated exhaustion from the previous duels.  

For some reason, he had given himself little time to recuperate after each one.   

The results had turned his brow into a waterfall of sweat mixed with ragged breaths.  

*It’s impressive he’s still able to look alive after three bouts. But…*  

Such vitality did not deter her path. She dashed another circle around him.  

*It’s only a small matter of time until he loses his patience. That’s when I’ll strike.*  

But the commander was not foolish enough to let that opportunity come easily.  

He remained on the defense and kept his eyes concentrated on her footwork.  

Then he briefly closed them and took a deep breath.  

*Or he could do that\!*  

Right as he was breathing, she threw another feint, forcing him to slash horizontally.  

She rolled under the slash and got her blade close to his neck–  

**WHAM.**  

The slash was a feint. He had whacked the butt of the blade into her chest, forcing her to stagger back.   

On instinct, she backed away further before Victor could draw the blade to her neck.  

“Augh, so close\!” shouted Pendra.  

“Don’t give up, big sis\!\!” cheered Lily.  

The support was enough to get her head back into the fight.  

She got her footing back together before getting her stance back.  

“Not good enough. You’ll need to find a better advantage than that.”  

*Yes, I got too greedy there. Seems he holds more patience than I thought.*   

Her steps regained their usual speed as she charged in.  

*More for him to lose, then.*

<br>
<br>

At the highest point in Ashwright, Gerwyn wielded his new weapon.  

“121…122…123…”  

*Kick off, punch, retract. Kick off, punch, retract.*

<br>
<br>

“He’s deteriorating.” Mercer muttered.  

“You talking about Vic?” asked Pendra.  

“Who else, *dumbass*?”

<br>
<br>

The world that bustled from below the tower began to fade.  

“128…129…130…”  

*Kick off, punch, retract. Kick off, punch, retract.*

<br>
<br>

“Well, what makes you say that?” Pendra inquired, unfazed by Mercer’s scathing tone. “Is it ‘cuz you wanted him to fight back some more when choking him out earlier?”  

“Not even that. The bastard thinks that since he’s the oh-so-special-commander-set-to-rule, he now has the power to fight us all without a proper break. That rock of a skull he’s got wouldn’t understand pacing even if it slammed him across the head.”

<br>
<br>

The sun that advanced from above the tower began to fade.  

“140…141…142…”  

*Can’t forget how to shift my weight. Kick off, punch, retract.*

<br>
<br>

“Well…he was serious enough to go all out when it was me and him earlier, and he has been sweating and panting a lot right now.” Lily added. “For once, you’re right, Mercer. Victor’s pushing himself harder than ever, so we need to give him some support once this match ends.”

<br>
<br>

The doubts of learning the technique began to fade.  

“156…157…158…159…”  

*Kick off, punch, retract. Kick off, punch, retract.* 

<br>
<br>

“It’s a better observation than anything you’ll ever amount to, *you spoiled accident*.” Mercer retorted with a sharp elbow to her shoulder. “The sooner one of them passes out or breaks a bone, the better–.”   

“Alright, that is it\!\!” she shouted. “You better be ready for the next round, Mercer\!\! I’m gonna teach you a lesson once and for all\!\!”  

“You’ll put me to sleep ten seconds into class, *accident.*”

<br>
<br>

The shadowy mire Georg left behind began to fade.  

“175…176…177…178…”  

*Can’t lose this rhythm now. Kick off, punch, retract.* 

<br>
<br>

“Why, you–\!\!”  

“Okay, okay, settle down, *girlies*.” Pendra said while restraining Lily with mock-calm. “Just ‘cause you’re both on *that time* of the cycle again doesn’t mean you’re allowed to be at each other’s–”  

“Ugh, shut up, Penny\! Never say that again, you’re disgusting\! And you’re next after I’m done with–”   

“You won’t be fighting either of them.” Nadis interjected, slicing through the conversation like a silent knife through butter. 

<br>
<br>

The thousand wounds inflicted by *It* began to fade.  

“190…191…192…193…”  

*I need to aim higher than this. Kick off, punch, retract.*

<br>
<br>

“And why's that?” Lily tilted her head.  

“I’m going to take you on while Victor rests.” Nadis replied while flexing her right hand into a fist. Sparks of blue electricity charged and surged around her fingers.  

“Ho-hoh, better be careful, Lily. The second Ashwright’s out for your blood now.” Pendra commented with intrigue.

<br>
<br>

The crumbling stairs he had walked through to get here began to fade.  

“208…209…210…211…”  

*I’ll engrave the jab into my arms.* 

<br>
<br>

“And what did I do to deserve that\!?” the prodigy exclaimed with a tinge of frustration.  

“Don’t take it so personally. That’s a bad habit of yours.” said Nadis as she unclenched her fist and charged more sparks. “I noted your lack of perception last night, but it seems you still need a more…*direct lesson* on how it works.”

<br>
<br>

The memories of his visit here yesterday began to fade.  

“217…218…219…220…”  

*And I’ll use the snap…*

<br>
<br>

“Wha–\!? I know how to do perception, Nadis\! People say I’ve got a sharp head\!”  

“Then consider this a chance…”

<br>
<br>

Gerwyn and Nadis unintentionally spoke the same idea.  

“To *become sharper*.”
