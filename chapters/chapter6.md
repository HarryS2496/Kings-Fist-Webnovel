**Earlier today…**

“3994…3995…3996…3997…3998…3999…4000\!”

By the time Gerwyn had finished, the sun had begun to set.  

*So evening finally comes. Did not think I’d be here this long.*  

The fresh aches of his arms had finally hit him, yet they did not feel limp.  

Despite his exhaustion, vigor still ran through his body. Perhaps he hungered for more.  

He picked Knuckle Duster back up from the ground and dusted off his sleeves and pants. As he began to walk back to the entrance, his hand slightly shuddered as it embraced the doorknob.   

*Should take my time back down. It’ll be near nightfall when I head back.*  

As he entered through the door and stared back at the stairs below him, enshrouded by a darkness undeterred by what little daylight there was to shine from the door and windows.   

Fear did not overcome him, for this sight was akin to yesterday’s.   

An inevitable abyss awaited him below, but the memory of its path remained fresh in his head.  

*Just have to remember the loose stones as I walk back down. This will be riskier than the descent, but–*  

*“There’s few who walk up this tower, and fewer who walk back down.”*  

Georg’s earlier words assaulted his mind at an inopportune time, forcing him to step back.  

Another wall greeted him from behind. It was the same wall he faced when finishing the climb up this tower, both yesterday and today.  

It looked even darker than when he had seen it, for the sun that bled through the rustic door was once again retreating from this small world.  

There was no other exit besides the one that stared him down. Gerwyn knew this too well.  

*Then I’ll need to be one of the fewer.*  

It was either that or remaining in this tower, stuck in the pitch black rot of its insides.   

Silent admonishment towards such an irrational fear pushed him forward as he began the trek down.   

The steep distance between each step made the trip feel even more dangerous than the climb upwards. But past experience had shown the path was not invincible.  

Still silent, he summoned a small ember in his hands as the door above became more distant.   

*Can’t waste too much. There’s also the long walk back to the castle.*  

Each time he saw the waning light of the windows down below, he extinguished the dim ember.  

The tug of war between the need to conserve magic and the desire to see further commenced.  

*Remember, Gerwyn.*   

If one side were to overpower the other, it could spell imminent disaster.  

*Your pool is far below the standards of a magus, so each cinder needs to count.*  

An unmoving stalemate was the only acceptable outcome for both sides.  

*You can guess the steps that may crumble below, but take precaution regardless.*  

The memory of two ascensions and one descension helped him avoid an instant demise.  

*The longer you remain still, the further the sun will slip away. Its light is needed here.*  

The memory of many nights alone in the Ashen Archives refined his senses in dim light.  

*This is now the third floor.*   

The memory of despondent stares at each door refined his mental image of the watchtower.  

*As long as this pace remains, the path will–*  

**Crack.**  

The sound immediately had him step back up out of reflex.  

A loose step revealed its existence, as if waiting to interrupt his pace at its best.  

*Whew, that was close.*  

Though the mental image was refined, it remained imperfect.  

*That step still looks like it's holding, but I should remember to avoid it regardless. Or…should I push it further in to make it fall? It’ll make the danger more clear so I’ll know to avoid it more carefully.*  

A typical adventurer would have immediately stepped around it and made a mental note to never visit the tower again.  

*No, not now. Loosening that might also crumple the steps around it.*   

But Gerwyn was not an adventurer on a mere visit.   

*And there’s not enough light here to know if it’s a risk worth taking.*   

He was the unknown dweller of a land few dared to tread.  

*I’ll consider it when the next morning comes with a brighter sun in tow.*  

And as its one dweller, surviving without catastrophe was his top priority.  

As the next window passed him by and the darkness returned, he reignited the spark in his hand.  

A breath of accomplished relief escaped him as the ground floor became clear.  

He did not hesitate to speed his pace and head straight for the door.  

As the fresh air and glow of the evening’s advent blasted him, he could not help but breathe it all in. He was surprised to find the sunset still lingering in the sky, for it was proof his descent was quicker than the last.  

*From here, the rest of the way back shouldn’t be a problem.*  

The weight of exhaustion began to reveal itself on his legs.  

*…I hope.*

<br>
<br>

The way back to the castle remained the same as it did before.   

His mind tuned the world out, but not because of the weight of life and death that haunted him yesterday.   

*There’s still some things about this book that I don’t understand.*  

The scholar within, now renowned with a newfound hunger, wished to comprehend the puzzle he pulled out of his satchel.  

*Knuckle Duster.*  

When he finally made it into the castle and was sure no one could take notice of him on the walk to his chambers, he opened the pages back to the foreword.   

*The more I think about what I’m seeing here, the less sense it makes.*  

He squinted at the piece that captured the author’s being once again.  

*What’s the light source that’s being used here?*   

Now that he had an idea of the manual’s logos, understanding the source of where it came from was a secondary priority.  

*If this were a painting, it would be easy to spot even a slight smudge from one replicating candlelight against clothing and skin. But I already know there’s no smudges like that here. The foreword mentioned nothing on magic theory, so pinning this on even a spell I don’t know is out of the question. On top of that, this piece doesn’t have the yellowish glow of candles. No, it’s…pure white?*  

He scratched his forehead, perplexed by the outer details of a moment between the mysterious couple.   

*White hot flames, maybe? Those are dangerous, given their heat, and no one in Axiom would dare use such sacred pyres for merely lighting a building. So there’s definitely another source at play here. Electricity, perhaps? It’s certainly possible, given the light they produce, but you’d need a complex machine to even contain such a volatile element. And I’ve only read about those kinds of machines in D-100%.*  

Though he had some awareness of the path to take to his chambers and the world around that path, racking his brain to further understand each conundrum that popped up was the higher priority of the now.  

*Actually, that’s another question entirely: what sort of building are they in? Even in Katorus Academy and other architecture I’ve studied in drawings, I don’t recall one even remotely similar to where they’re at right now.*  

Behind the couple in the piece was some sort of small, elevated arena with ropes as barriers. The floor, or what little he could see of the floor, was easy to recognize as carpet, but it seemed to stretch through the entire building floor as if it covered the whole area. A white wall stood off into the distance, with a row of small windows above it.   

*Even when I find a reference that makes sense here, it’s in a way I haven’t seen before. It would be easier to narrow down this book’s origins if I knew a proper frame of reference this building relates to, except I don't. If that’s the case, then…*  

A hypothesis began to take shape.  

*It's safe to say this book was made in a world outside Axio–*  

**Bump.**  

Gerwyn felt another shoulder unexpectedly clash against his.   

On instinct, he closed the book and shoved it into his satchel.   

The newborn hypothesis would have to wait.  

“Oh, uh, I’m so–”  

**THUMP.**  

The apology faltered upon identifying the one he had bumped into.  

“...And what the hell is *your* deal, huh?”  

Mercer.  

His companion, Pendra, had kept walking unbothered, but the question prompted him to stop and look back at the newfound standoff.  

“Uh, Mercer? We gotta–”  

“Shut up. I’m asking the questions here.”   

He glared at Gerwyn again, channeling the fury of *It* in his eyes.   

“You. Answer.”  

**THUMP.**  

“We’re in a big hallway, yet you can’t even look at what’s in front of you?”   

*Shit, not again.*  

“All this space to move out of the way, yet you think you can just hide your face in yet another book and walk like you own this place?”  

*This isn’t going to end well even if I do nothing.*  

Pendra seemed to catch on to the fact too, as a mixture of awkwardness and worry prompted him to step into the standoff. He got between the two brothers and put a hand on Mercer’s shoulder.  

**THUMP.**  

“Come on, man, this isn’t a good time for–”  

“I said. Shut up. *Penny*.”  

The youngest of the three backed off slightly, but remained alert.   

*Pendra won’t be enough to stop him once things get worse.*  

“Either there’s nothing in that head of yours, or there’s something you’ve got to say here.” Mercer continued.  

*I can only hope my injuries after this aren’t too fatal.*  

“What, are you aiming for some record for reading all the shit below us?”  

*I can only hope…right?*   

Silence.   

He clicked his tongue and swung his right fist forward.   

“Say something already, you *godsdamned cri–\!\!*”  

**CRACK.**  

Commanded by instinct and a newborn habit, Gerwyn’s fist flew forward before he realized it.   

The freshly sharpened jab landed directly at Mercer's face, outspeeding his fist and staggering him one step back. A small river of blood began to slowly leak from his nostrils.  

Silent disbelief overcame the three of them.   

Mercer wiped the blood off his nose and stared at it. Though blood itself did not faze him, his hand trembled under the shock.  

Pendra clenched his teeth in a shocked grimace, for he knew his older brothers well enough to know the only possible way this could end up next.   

Adrenaline pulsated through Gerwyn’s knuckle, washing over the growing soreness of his arms.  

No one knew how much time passed afterwards.  

Minutes?  

Hours?  

Days?  

No matter what it was, the three felt the silence lasted far longer.  

“U-um…” Gerwyn finally blurted out.   

“*Um*\!? The hell do you mean ‘um’\!?” Mercer immediately grabbed him by the collar. “You think you're getting away with this one alive, bastard\!? No way in hell\!\!”  

**THUMP.**  

Gerwyn’s fear overtook the adrenaline, leaving him paralyzed once again. This was the opportunity Mercer needed to throw him against the stone wall. The painful impact seared his back, taking air out of his lungs.   

**THUMP.**  

Pendra immediately latched onto Mercer and held back his arms.  

“Hey, Mercer\!\!\! It’s not a big deal, let’s just settle down and–  

“Get off\!\! I’m not settling down until this wretch dies already\!\!” Mercer stomped on Pendra's foot to shake him off.  

He clenched his teeth to hold back a scream, but the pain loosened his grip.   

**THUMP.**  

Mercer wasted no time resuming the beatdown.   

He got two punches in before Pendra held him back again.  

As the two kept shouting at each other and the punches kept coming, Gerwyn’s vision blurred and his body began to shake.  

**THUMP.**  

***Who are you when nothing’s left?***  

The words of *Knuckle Duster* echoed into him, ringing clearer than the reality he saw.  

*I need to move.*   

**THUMP.**  

***Who are you when nothing’s left?***  

*I can’t rely on Pendra for this; I need to move\!*  

**THUMP.**  

***Who are you when nothing’s left?***  

*If I want to retreat, I need to move\!*  

**THUMP.**  

***Who are you when nothing’s left?***  

*Gods be damned, why can’t I move\!?*  

**THUMP.**  

***Who are you when nothing’s left?***  

*Everything’s shaking…everything’s falling apart again…*  

**THUMP.**  

***Who are you when nothing’s left?***  

*…There’s no escaping the answer to that.*  

**THUMP.**   

*Even now, I–*  

“*What is the meaning of this*\!\!?” roared a voice from the halls.  

“Ah, shit.” Pendra muttered.   

As Mercer shook him off one last time, the two had stopped their struggle, for a greater one had just arrived.  

Victor Ashwright.  

And behind him, their mother. The queen of the castle.  

“Ten minutes. I look away for *ten minutes* and there’s a fight happening between the three of you. Do any of you understand what such chicanery will tell the rest of these walls\!?” shouted the furious commander.  

**THUMP.**  

Gerwyn couldn’t even bear to look at anyone.   

As he leaned against the wall and his body remained paralyzed under the atmosphere’s sudden tension, the adrenaline in his right hand began to wear off. Though it no longer pulsed, the blow it had dealt was a mark he still felt in the bones of his knuckles.  

Mercer was the only one who remained unfazed by their older brother.   

“So now the walls speak to you? Your eye for delusions sure grows sharper with each passing day.”  

“And *you* prove to be more incorrigible with each passing day. Time and again, I’ve said that this behavior unbecoming of your status *must cease*, yet it clings to you as lifeblood\! Now, I will ask what happened here, and you will answer the questions with the words expected from the fourth successor of Ashwright\!”  

“I don’t need to tell you shit, it’s as clear as–”  

“Then someone else *will*.” Beatrice calmly interrupted, hiding her mouth with a fan the color of a deep azure. Her eyes fixated upon the youngest of the princes.  

“...Wait, me? Uh, alright, then.” Pendra scratched his head, possibly to scramble an explanation for the unbelievable sight that happened five minutes ago. “Okay, so we were just walking our own ways in this hall, then Mercer here bumped into Gerwyn and–”  

“The cripple bumped into me, dumbass. You saw his big head stuck in that book.”  

“Yeah, yeah, whatever, it doesn’t really matter. *Anyways*, after they bumped into each other, Mercer started trying to pick a fight, as per usual, but then got punched in the face for it.”  

“Gods forbid I ask a wretch why he still bothers to live a wretch.”  

Victor clenched his teeth. “What part of “words expected from the fourth successor” do you not–”  

“Successor this, successor that, how about you shut the hell up already\!? Go find some third-rate soldier or priest to spread your half-assed sermons onto\!\!”  

*You should have retreated when there was still a chance, Gerwyn.*   

“The both of you will not get anywhere like this. Remain silent.” commanded Beatrice.   

As the two brothers got the message, she turned back to Pendra. “To continue, you said this fight started with Mercer being punched in the face. Can I assume that you threw the first blow and he took it out on Gerwyn?”  

“Oh no, I tried to stop the fight. Gerwyn’s the one who punched him.” Pendra immediately corrected.  

Beatrice showed a flicker of surprise. “...Gerwyn did it?”   

He nodded. “The funny thing is, Mercer was about to strike first, but *his* punch was way faster.”   

Her blinks became more conscious.  

“Yeah, I’m still shocked about it right now.” added Pendra.  

“And you’ve got a death wish too, apparently.” growled Mercer.  

“Speak for yourself, idiot\!" he chastised in a hushed voice. “You could just, y’know, not have a comeback for everything and we can all walk away from this without any more trouble\!”  

Beatrice’s attention shifted from the two brothers to Gerwyn as he finally got up from the ground. “Is what he says the truth?”  

*No use lying about it now.*   

He nodded with hesitation, unsure if the look she gave him still had *It* or pure surprise.  

Mental exhaustion prevented him from telling the difference.  

“It appears we will need to discuss this further with your father. Victor, do you have any business elsewhere today?”  

“None remaining, mother.” responded Victor.  

“Good, your assistance may be needed for this. All of you, come with me. The king will see to your judgement this time.”  

As she walked off, Gerwyn was at the mercy of her lead, following by instinct.   

She did not need to elaborate where their destination was.  

*This is the worst.*

<br>
<br>

The next thing he knew, Gerwyn was sitting in the king’s office. His seat and Mercer’s had been pulled up to be directly in front of the blackwood desk, with Sherman on the other end as its master.   

*When was the last time I came here?*  

Dimly lit lanterns evenly strewn around the walls illuminated with silence. Two wide shelves faced the king’s desk on each side containing written records of various matters from him, his predecessors, and any close advisors involved in his personal work. All records and tomes in the compact shelves had been meticulously arranged in alphabetical order. Organization was but merely one of many famed skills Ashwright’s king sharpened too well.  

*As long as I remain silent, this should go by quickly.*  

Victor stood on the right side of the desk with two watchful eyes over the entire room. Beatrice and Pendra were sitting on a dark velvet couch on the left side. As the former kept her own silent analysis of the atmosphere, the latter explained to Sherman the fight that had happened earlier ago. The only other noise in the room was the rapid writing Sherman unleashed upon a sheet of paper as his seventh son told the truth.  

After the room fell silent in anticipation again, Sherman reviewed the paper. The look in his eyes immediately calculated a final judgement.  

“This battle was yet another pointless struggle our kingdom must not know about. A fruitless inflation of ego at the cost of another’s dignity. Understand, Mercer, that this is the last straw to end the last straws. I sincerely thought those years of discipline at Katorus Academy would make you someone far better than this, but it appears that was a lapse in judgement after all.”  

Mercer did not waver under the glare of their father. With crossed arms and a straightened posture, he held no fear in the face of Ashwright’s strongest.  

*Even for him, this sort of defiance isn’t normal. Did something happen during training today?*  

“Are you listening?” Sherman said with slightly more clarity.  

“Yeah, I heard you the first time, *Father.*” Mercer replied. “And I already know no matter what else I could say in my defense, you’ll take the cripple’s side. So just get it over with already.”  

“Be wary of how you address your king,” Victor gritted his teeth.   

“Nobody’s talking to you, stonehead. Shut up.” Mercer replied, still unfazed.  

Sherman cleared his throat to silence the room. “This time, your punishment will not be so merciful. Five months alone in the wilderness of the *Ashen Highlands* will keep that wrathful streak of yours in check.”  

**THUMP.**  

*What?*  

Gerwyn’s vision went from staring into the dark carpet to glancing between Sherman and Mercer, then around the rest of the room. It seemed both Beatrice and Pendra were as unnerved as he was, though the former hid it better.  

“Five months?” Mercer asked.  

“Yes, five months. Your exile comes in three days.”  

Mercer looked down at the carpet for a moment, then shrugged slightly.  

“Alright, then,” he replied in a flat tone.  

**THUMP.**  

*Wait, what?*  

An air of surprise and perplexity swept the room, palpable to a point Gerwyn could tell that he was not the only one who felt it.  

*Why’s he accepting that so casually? No, never mind that; what is Father thinking, sending him to the middle of the Highlands for that long?*   

“This is far from your first visit there. I can assume you understand the near impossibility of leaving without heading further north or back to this kingdom.”  

*Soldiers looking to rise in rank stay there for a month at most, even in groups.*  

“Yeah, no shit. That’s common knowledge you’ve imprinted unto us, withering *bastard*.”  

*The longest I’ve heard anyone willingly camp there was when Victor’s did it alone for three months. If I recall correctly, even he struggled with survival.*  

“Push this any further and see what happens, Mercer.” declared Victor, no longer restraining his contempt. “You’ve already done far enough during practice today; do not try our patience\!”  

*What happened during the spars to prompt this level of confidence?*  

“Oh, give it a rest already, *commander*.” Mercer snapped back. “The only reason you even care is that you’re still bitter over that earlier match. Hate to break it to you, but those *neck marks* might not wear off for a while.”   

Gerwyn looked up and, to his surprise, there were indeed markings from a chain around his neck. The same chain that made up the ball and whip Mercer used in spars.  

*Victory through strangulation. I’ve seldom heard of Victor losing to Mercer before.*   

“Did the both of you already forget what I said earlier?” Beatrice interrupted from the sidelines. “Such squabbles will take this discussion nowhere. Remain silent in the presence of the king’s judgement.”  

*Wait…is that why he holds no fear now? Choking out a man’s still far from enough proof he can survive the Ashen Highlands\!*   

“Thank you, Beatrice.” Sherman replied. “This matter cannot be resolved by mere repetition of past conflicts. The two of you would do well to remember that for the future.”   

*And even if he’s already been there before, staying for that long is another matter entirely. Forget punishment; this sentence might as well be a death penalty\!*  

“Besides, *you* look as if you have something to say on this matter." Sherman continued as he suddenly turned to Gerwyn.  

**THUMP.**  

Goosebumps invaded his skin.  

*Gods be damned, I don’t.*   

“U-um…no, I don’t.” The words were shaky as they escaped Gerwyn’s lips.  

“Do not refuse a question from your superior.” Victor demanded.  

“It is fine. Let him speak,” said Sherman.   

**THUMP.**  

Silence. It suffocated as he tried to muster a response.  

*Think, Gerwyn, think\! What are the right words for this?*   

He gripped his knees and tried to concentrate within his own head.   

*I don’t have a reason to help him out, and he does have to face repercussions in some way.*   

**THUMP.**  

*As long as I remain silent, he’ll just go away, and I won’t have to worry as much about my life here…right?*  

What felt like mere seconds to the world became minutes to him.  

**Thump.**  

*No, what the hell am I thinking, writing this off? Even if there’s no reason, taking responsibility is important. This happened because of my ignorance, yet Mercer is getting punished. If I let this pass, I’ll be complicit in his death.*   

**Thump.**  

*I can’t become a murderer over an incident like this. So it’s time to speak up for once.*  

A deep breath finally put his heart at ease. To his father, it was a silent cue to listen.  

“…I-I don’t think…this punishment is a good idea.” answered Gerwyn.  

The silent atmosphere of the office grew more intense with each passing second.   

**Thump.**  

“Justice must be served one way or another.” Sherman replied. “What makes this punishment a bad idea?”  

“Well…I was the one who bumped into him, and…didn’t watch my step.”  

“Yet he chose to pick the battle.”  

**THUMP.**  

“I’m the one…who landed the first hit.”  

“Yet it was in self defense, therefore that can be overlooked. What matters is that he chose to pick the battle.”  

*No surprise that’s what he would say.*   

Gerwyn’s mind scrambled furiously to find the right words for the conversation.  

*Gah, think harder\! There has to be some other way I can object\!*  

**THUMP.**  

He swallowed a lump in his throat.  

“U-um, then…isn’t there another way to serve justice for this case?”  

“There is none more suitable.” Sherman immediately replied. “Unless you have a suggestion for a punishment instead, this is the only fitting judgement.”  

“I don’t have one, but…”  

**THUMP.**  

Gerwyn felt the eyes of *It* piercing into him once again.   

They came from the King, the Authority, and the Fury all at once.  

*You can’t falter here, Gerwyn. Not after climbing that tower twice.*   

“Look, this…is too excessive, even for Ashwright’s creed.”  

A bead of sweat began to trickle down.  

“The Highlands are…extremely dangerous, even among experienced warriors. Between the wildlife, harsh conditions, and our…*problematic* relations with the Highlanders, sending someone there for that long is…well…”  

**THUMP.**  

Gerwyn felt a piercing glare from his right and mentally braced himself.   

It had been far too long since he had spoken up in a matter such as this.  

“I-it’s a *death sentence*. You can’t just…send someone there for months and expect them to come back in one–”  

**BOOM.**  

The impact from Mercer’s fist had knocked him off the chair.   

Pain seared through both his right cheek and left side as he struggled to recover from the blow.  

“A death sentence, you say? Speak for yourself, *wretch*.” said Mercer, uncaring of the shock he had drawn in the office.  

“Hey\!” protested Pendra.  

“Mercer\!\!” shouted Victor.  

The assailant did not listen. Neither did the victim.  

“Remind me of something, since that’s one thing you’re good at. Which one of us has camped out in the Highlands and who hasn’t?”  

**THUMP.**  

“Enough is enough\!\!” Victor’s patience had finally run its course. He restrained Mercer before he could approach any further.  

The Authority knew this long before today, but to restrain the Fury was to commit to an arduous struggle.   

“Answer the question already\! Which one of us is it\!?” he shouted while resisting Victor’s grasp.  

**THUMP.**  

“...I-it’s you.” Gerwyn replied with a wavering certainty.  

“Yeah, that’s right; *me*\! I’m the one who’s lived there, while you’ve passed out over far less\! So you’ve got some nerve, thinking you can spit on my strength after getting away with this bullshit\! No way in hell would I agree to this with the intent to die like you would\!”  

**THUMP.**  

“But…t-that’s not–”   

“‘That’s not’ what? What, are you trying to say it still isn’t possible? You think because you’re too weak to even count as a person, it means you’ve got some perspective on weakness or some other pretentious bullshit? Don’t make me–”   

“Mercer, stop\!\! You’re just digging your own epitaph at this point\!\!” Pendra stood up to cut into the argument. He checked on Gerwyn to see if he was in serious pain, then sighed in relief at his unusual durability. “Look, I have to agree with *him* on this; this really isn’t a punishment we should go through with\! Last straw or not, five months in the *Highland*s of all places is an unhinged–”  

“Oh, don’t *you* start, Penny. I just said I know exactly what I’m digging for.” he growled. “You wanna know the truth, *cripple*? We may be in the same family, but there’s one clear difference between people like you and me. People like you just cower behind the dresses of this forsaken kingdom and its bullshit, telling the world it’s ok to live as a miserable weakling, to never seek–”  

With one spell, the tirade had come to a sudden end.   

In one moment, Victor had successfully shoved Mercer to the side, and in another, he was partially frozen on the wall.   

He had been pushed into a spot where Beatrice instantly summoned water below zero to keep her volatile son restrained.  

The queen had gotten up from the sofa and slowly walked towards him, each step accompanied by a subtle yet sharp crackling of glassy ice.  

“As your father *said*,” said Beatrice, voice low and furious, “*this* is the last straw to end *all* last straws. Five months is far too generous of a punishment; I suggest your exile be extended to six. How does that sound, dear?”   

“As exact as what I would decree.” Sherman replied while writing more notes.  

“Good.” She gave the room a quick scan, then turned to Gerwyn and Pendra. “Your resolve to defend your brother deserves credit where it is due. Unfortunately, this is also a decision your father and I will not be changing our minds on, nor will we consider it a death sentence.”   

Another expected result.  

“And you’re sure of this?” was all Gerwyn could reply with. It was a miracle he could still find his voice.  

“Yes, we are. Now sit back down, you two.”  

“But Mother–” Pendra started.  

“*Sit*.”  

Her commanding eyes were enough to force him back to the couch, and in a state more nervous than when he had left it.   

He exchanged a look with Gerwyn, who only shook his head.  

*Well, it was an attempt. There’s nothing else I can say, so please let this be the end of it–*  

**FWOOM.**  

A fierce flame engulfed the icy prison Mercer had been shackled to.   

*Self immolation?*  

Blazes radiated, slowly melting the prison and bringing spirit back to his cold body.  

*Is that how far he’ll go to throw away his life?*   

Though the burning pain carved itself into him, his rage remained undeterred.  

“You’ve got one thing correct. This isn’t a death sentence at all. Really, it’s a festive gift to savor down to the last drop. No matter how long the exile, I’ll spend as much time as I need to make those mountains up north crumble to my feet. And once that’s finished…you and the rest of this kingdom better be ready.”  

He shoved Beatrice to the side and made his way to the door.   

The violent glare his eyes bore met Gerwyn.  

“That means you, cripple. Best to count your days, because if that heart of yours doesn’t make them numbered, *I will*.”  

**THUMP.**  

“Seven months it is, then.” remarked Sherman. Even his tolerance was running low.  

Not that Mercer cared anymore, for he had kicked open the door and stormed off. No part of him cared to look back one last time.  

As Beatrice dusted off her shoulder and closed the office doors, an impervious silence suffocated the office once again.  

“The two of you did your best to keep him in line, so you’ll be free to leave in just a moment.” she told Gerwyn and Pendra with a subtle smile of reassurance.  

The two brothers were about to sigh a breath of relief in unison–  

“Are you sure about that, Mother?” Victor objected. “There’s a good reason we’ve put these two here for judgement as well.”  

Pendra’s interrupted moment to relax had soured his demeanor into irritation. “*Come on*, Vic, it’s been long enough and we’ve done our job as witnesses. It’s getting late, can we just–”  

“Silence, Pendra. You and Gerwyn have spoken enough.” he snapped.  

“But he speaks the truth, Victor.” Beatrice added in, tilting her head in perplexity at the sudden statement. “If these two have spoken enough, would it not be common sense to let them retire for the night?”  

“Not when there’s room for necessary improvement,” he replied. “The blame of this incident may lie entirely within Mercer, but your conduct is also lacking, Gerwyn.”  

*Here it comes.*  

“You kept yourself absorbed in a book while walking in a hall, uncaring of what was around you. Why in the seven would you let yourself be that careless on royal grounds? It was one thing that you bumped into one of your brethren, but there was a greater chance you could have also instigated conflict with an advisor or knight\!”  

*There was.*   

“Okay, that’s going too far\!\!” Pendra cut in again, now indignant. “Nobody besides us was in that hallway, how was he supposed to know that–”  

“What did I *say* about *silence*\!?”   

“I’m not gonna just sit here while you–”  

“That is not an option you can take towards a superior, least of all a prince\!”  

*Sorry, Pendra, but it’s pointless to find a defense for my actions.*  

“Vic, we’re being kept here for things that aren’t going to matter in the end anyways\! Gods forbid either of us have a justifiable reason to not–”  

“Conduct is far more than mere *things*, Pendra Ashwright. They are what defines our status in this kingdom. And the two of you will learn every nook to its meaning before this  foolishness reflects poorly on the rest of us.”  

*I already know just how far removed I’ve been from such conduct, no matter what has been tried.*  

“Fooli–? You just said that the ‘blame for this incident’ lied within Mercer\!\! That’s basically admitting we’re innocent in this case, so what are you even mad at right now? What’s the problem here\!?” Pendra exclaimed, still confused.  

“The *problem* is in what the innocent should have done instead.”  

*Nothing was ever going to come out of fighting back.*  

“Vic, I was trying to stop the fight\! You and Mother should have seen that for yourselves\! What do you even mean, ‘the problem’s in what we should have done instead?’”  

“I’m not speaking about what you did that time.”  

“Then what the hell are you going on about right now\!?”  

Victor ignored him and turned back to Gerwyn.  

“As for *you*, surely even you must know better than this as of now.”   

*…Nothing was ever going to come out of fighting back?*  

The question he had seldom asked took priority over Victor's voice that he had heard time and again.  

“Do you still understand the dire risks that come with what you can do in your condition?”  

*That’s not true. I drew the first blood against him.*  

The long lost adrenaline in his right hand pulsated once again.  

“First, there was the reckless venture to the watchtower yesterday, and today, this\!”  

*I can barely recall the last time I’ve ever done anything like that.*  

The feeling from when it had bent the fork began to well up back into him.  

“What could have possibly happened recently that compelled you towards such *peculiar* actions? If you do this for recognition, then such is a fool’s errand\!”  

*Could I truly call it a fool’s errand to defend myself?*  

It transformed into a pit of bubbling tar and began to well up in his soul.  

“Are you even listening, Gerwyn Ashwright\!?”  

**THUMP.**  

Every last bit of his self-control fought against the weight of such questions.  

“Do you understand your position here, in these times of strife? Those incapable against the throes of danger should not near themselves to such lands, yet you’ve–”  

“Victor\! That is *enough*\!\!”  

With four words, Beatrice once again commanded the attention of the room.  

But the calm authority of a monarch did not accompany her voice this time.  

“Pendra is *correct* on this matter; you go too far. I brought you to this office as a chance to help us pass down judgement towards the guilty, not towards the innocent.”  

“And even if the possibility of what Gerwyn did could have been avoided, that does not excuse the right for you to berate him for it.” Sherman added while scribbling down more notes.  

Victor turned to him.   

“Punish me if you must for my impertinence\!” he declared. “But this is still a matter I must voice my concerns on. Mistakes are to be corrected, and to judge is to offer the proper corrections towards what is important.”  

This statement convinced the king to set his pen down and slowly fold his hands.   

Though he appeared composed, Gerwyn felt a storm roar while catching a glimpse of his eyes toward Victor.   

“It appears you did not understand what we speak of here. That diatribe you referred to as ‘voicing concerns’ is the *impertinence* in question. It would have cost nothing and helped greatly to have never uttered those words.”  

Victor had weathered many storms in his lifetime.  

“Even so, it must be done, Father. As your *chosen successor*, I–”  

“No, it must not. And as my *chosen successor*, you still have much to learn about what it means to pass judgement.”  

Yet the king’s storm could still coerce with ease.  

“The two of you are dismissed.” he told Gerwyn and Pendra.  

Both of them did not hesitate to get up and walk away.   

As the thick, metal doors closed behind them, they could faintly overhear another discussion taking place inside.  

“Victor Ashwright. Perhaps it is time we had a proper chat about where your priorities as a commander must lie. First…” started Sherman.  

It did not take long for the conversation to fade out as they walked away.  

Pendra sighed as he slouched out of exhaustion. “Man, what in the seven has been going on today? It’s like good weather seems to bring the worst out of our family.”  

Gerwyn slowly planted his back against a wall.   

Though his heart had calmed down, his mind was on its last legs in an attempt to remain stable.  

“Honestly, it’s a good thing you didn’t come to practice today; things got…weird.” Pendra shrugged. “I dunno if it’s because Vic and Mercer are so used to the snowfall around here that actual sunlight pisses them off for some reason, but it wouldn’t surprise me if they didn’t. Though seriously, how does sunlight piss someone off so much that they’d fake a slipup just to get a chokehold that violent?”   

The context of this ‘slipup’ was meaningless compared to the aches that assaulted his worn-out arms.   

“And seriously, why in the seven is he being sent to the Highlands of all places? I feel like a better punishment in this case would be writing “I will not strike the audience during a spar” a thousand times on parchment or something. It’s less extreme in comparison and gets the point across faster, I think. Heh, but then again, he’d also have to write a bunch of other things a thousand times if we account for other stunts he’s pulled.” he chuckled.  

It was unclear if Pendra was filling in the silence or striking a conversation. Gerwyn longed for the strength to humor him, for he lacked it.  

“Say, this is kinda unrelated, but do you happen to know if something happened between Nadis and Vic, and what that might be? Cause that’s another reason *he’s* been so uppity today; they were holding back some shit until after dinner yesterday. I tried asking Georg about it, but he ended up doing his thing where he’s descriptive on some things but vague on what’s…”  

Pendra trailed off as he just noticed Gerwyn’s current state.  

“Um…”  

As the two stood alone, another bout of silence permeated the halls lit by a fading sunset.  

“Er…you know what, never mind.” Pendra ruffled his head. “Don’t worry too much about what happened today, I’ll, uh…see you tomorrow, I guess. Good night.” he added while walking off with a hurried wave.  

Gerwyn simply nodded his head as he watched Pendra slowly disappear from his sight. Soaking in the loneliness once more, he finally let his legs give out.  

*Gods, that felt like an eternity.*  

Even just raising his trembling hand and staring at it felt like carrying a block of lead.  

*I…really made someone bleed with this, huh?*  

As the memory of striking Mercer’s face came back, a slow stream of adrenaline pulsated once more in both hands.  

*And without getting into a fighting stance, too. That was far from the best I had.*  

Like a constellation, more thoughts began to connect together.  

*So what would have happened…if I had kept punching him?*   

There was no need for a night sky to decipher the answer behind connecting the crushed fork, the mysterious book *Knuckle Duster*, the tower, and Mercer’s nosebleed to reveal the bigger picture.  

*What else is this hand capable of?*  

The thick fog of Gerwyn’s world dissipated.  

After having walked in circles for too long, a straight road became clear to him.  

With determined focus, he looked upon his hand and clenched it into a fist.  

*I know what I must do now.*
