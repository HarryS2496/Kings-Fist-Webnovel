<h3>742, 27th of Quinedre</h3>

Gerwyn was nine again, lost in a vivid memory.  

It was another cool spring day of reading in the small lot he called his outside haven.   

There was a simple luxury to an aged tree and soft grass in a small land unseen by most.  

The hustle and bustle outside was nothing more than whispers. Only the faint chirping of birds and the chimes of a faraway bell visited this abode.  

Another day to parse through *Within the Body’s Core* by Theodore Crow.  

“Heeeeeey, Jerry\!\!\!”  

He knew who that high-pitched, boisterous voice belonged to.   

Its owner dragged two shovels inside the lot and dropped them on the stone wall.  

**CLANG.**  

He flinched, then sighed. “What is it, Shen?”  

“Come on\! You could at least *pretend* you're happy to see me\!” she shouted with her hands on her hips.   

“I was happy – until some loud kid started shouting while banging shovels around.” he retorted in a deadpan tone.  

“You’re also a kid, you know\! We’re the same age\!”  

“Only in physical terms. Mentally, I beg to differ.”  

“You’re a mentally old man, just like my grandpa\!”  

“Not your grandpa again. Given everything you’ve said about him, I’d rather be anything else a thousand times over.”  

“You take that back\! He’s really good at punching and kicking people\! He'd even kick you if you said that\!” She swiftly pointed at him.  

“I’ll believe it when I see him do it in person.” he muttered.  

She sat nearby and peered at the book.   

“What are you even reading this time, anyways?”  

“*Within the Body’s Core.*”  

“Oooh, what’s it about? Sounds like a sad love story that takes place in the future\! And the book’s big, too\!” she excitedly remarked while tilting her head.  

“It’s a recent book on the heart.” he said while raising a finger, ready to deliver a lecture. “It covers how each organ of the heart plays a role in our biological system. For example, the circumflex artery is responsible for–”   

**SSSSSSNNNNNNRRRRRRKKKKKK.**  

She was sprawled out on the floor in a dramatic fashion, feigning loud snores.  

**SSSSSSNNNNNNRRRRRRKKKKKK.**  

“Hey, Shen\!\! You could at least listen\!\!”  

“What? You lost me at the part where you said ‘cirbumlesc artrey’ or something.” She patted off dirt and grass from her orange dress and frilly coat. “I fell asleep because you brought another boring book here\!”  

“Call it boring all you like, but this stuff’s important. You’ll need to know how the heart functions at some point.”  

“I won’t need it\! I’m a *princess* of Xaede, not a *bookworm* of Xaede\!” she protested.  

“Doesn’t mean you get to skip your studies, *Princess Shenael Lunendra*. Every function of the organ, no matter how minor it may seem, contributes to how we as people live and breathe, and you’ll meet plenty of scholars who–”  

“Ugh, shuddup\! Why are *you* always such an *egghead\!?*”  

“And why are *you* always such a *grey-haired ogre\!*?”   

“Excuse. Me\!\!?” Shenael’s veins flared as she lunged at him.   

The intense battle of pulling each other’s cheeks began; it lasted 5 minutes.  

There was no clear victor, and both were left exhausted by the end.  

When she wasn’t looking, he put a hand to his chest and caught his breath.  

“So…what’s with the shovels you brought?”  

“We’re going on an *adventure*\!” she cheered while throwing her hands up.  

“I know that already, Shen. You’ve said the same thing *every day* you come here.”  

“Because *every day’s* an adventure in your kingdom, Jerry\! My mom and dad don’t let me out of Xaede that much, so I wanna explore everything here\!”   

Her wolfish smile beamed with unfiltered joy.  

*Where does she get this enthusiasm from?*  

“Well…I get that, but it doesn’t answer my actual question.” he replied while ruffling his hair. “What’s with those shovels? And don’t say they’re for a prank on an innocent merchant you consider ugly or to vandalize a nearby tavern.”  

She puffed up her chest and crossed her arms with a smug, proud chuckle. “Those were yesterday’s adventures, *Prince of Ashwright*. Today’s adventure is different. It’s much bigger. It’s more…er, more…” Her bravado gradually dropped as she scratched her head with a puzzled look.  

“Hmmm…what’s that word again? I remember it was in that book you showed me. The one with the skeleton wearing a crown.”  

“*Undying Conqueror?*” he answered.  

“Yeah, and the evil guy in there used a word that started with an A in his speeches.”  

“...Ambitious?”  

She brightened up and tapped a palm with her fist.  

“Ah, *that’s* the one\! *Ambitious*\! Today’s adventure is gonna be *more ambitious*\!”  

“Okay, so where are we going this time?”  

“Outside\!”   

“As in…outside the kingdom?”  

She nodded proudly.  

“...Huh\!? You know that isn’t safe for either of us, right? If we get caught there, your parents and mine won’t let us live this down\!”  

“But if we do this without getting caught and then tell them, they’ll thank us later\! That’s what makes it ambitious\!”  

“What could we possibly be doing that could have them thank–”  

Gerwyn paused as his brain started connecting the dots together.   

“It’s currently late spring…so there’s not much snow, even outside of here…and you brought two shovels…wait.”  

Ever growing dread crept up as he looked back at her.  

“Don’t tell me we’re gonna…”  

“Yep\! We’re gonna–”

<br>
<br>

<h3>750, 4th of Quadedre</h3>

The sunlight suddenly assaulted Gerwyn’s eyes and jolted him awake.  

He sat up groggily and looked out the window to his left. The purple curtains had been parted the whole time, exposing him to the especially bright sun of today.  

“Urgh…”  

*I forgot to shut the curtains last night. And it had to be when I was having a good dream, too. Then again…I’d rather not be reminded of what happened afterwards.*   

He didn’t remember much after he acquired *Knuckle Duster* from the archives yesterday. The exhaustion from such an eventful day caused him to immediately dress down to his underwear and collapse onto the bed. Even as someone who passed the days reading alone, he felt ashamed for succumbing to such slovenly behavior.   

As his vision became more clear, he shuffled out of the sheets and slowly walked to pick up his old clothes: a white silk tunic with yellow accents, black pants, and a red sash belt. Though still clean at a glance, wrinkles and soot were in spots unseen by the naked eye. He then trudged to the small dark red cabinet and looked into the mirror attached on top.   

“Wow, I look terrible. Worse than usual.” he commented aloud.  

The crimson ginger shine of his wavy hair had dulled from a lack of care; the messy strands that stuck out weren’t from his usual bedhead this time. The bags under his eyes had still not gone away.   

*No wonder why they were asking about what I did yesterday.*   

He threw his old clothes into the large willow basket next to the cabinet, then headed to the closet right next to that. Opening the door, the same unremarkable clothes he had always known greeted him with little fanfare beyond the creak of the wooden door.  

*It’s not like those clothes were a huge loss. They can look good as new off being dry cleaned, and they’re not much different from what’s in here.*  

The point of the wardrobe was to look unremarkable.   

He took a black bathrobe on the far right and put it on.   

Then, he took another change of clothes from there and the cabinet.   

*Time to wash up.*  

Thankfully, the private bath was only two rooms away from his. As he walked out of his room and to his destination, no maids or relatives ran into him. That was more than enough to let him feel relieved.  

For the first time in a while, the quiet unease of being in the castle’s private bath had turned into quiet peace. By the time Gerwyn had finished brushing his teeth, the bath had already been filled. He cut the faucet short before it could spew any more warm water, then slowly got in. The bright sun emanating from the window next to the stone bathtub helped him feel at ease.  

This was the perfect environment to formulate a plan for the day.  

*It’s a nice day outside, I shouldn’t waste it practicing in this castle. But I can’t go to the training grounds in the backyard, since everyone else is likely there for drills and spars. Maybe it is a good thing I'm exempt from their training; it gives me time to find my own secret place to learn boxing.*  

As he lathered soap around the arms and chest, his mind ran through multiple options.  

*Should I go somewhere else nearby, like one of the tree gardens at the sides of the castle? No, one of our staff would see me, then rumors of ‘that-one-crippled-prince punching at air’ would spread, and I’d never hear the end of it.*  

*It* thrived off rumors.  

*Should I go to one of the bigger study rooms in the Ashen Archives? Given the layout of that place, I could hide in one of the more obscure meeting rooms there and make enough space if I were to move the desks. No, that’s too much work just to make a training ground, and it’s still inside even if I find a room above ground with a window. And advisors like to use those places to discuss matters in secret, so if one of them walked in, rumors of ‘that-one-crippled-bookworm-prince in the archives punching at air’ would spread, and I’d never hear the end of it.*  

He rolled his head back up and saw the stone ceiling.  

“I could never look Master Cen in the eye if she saw me doing boxing practice there.” he sighed while putting a hand to his face.  

*Should I go to that abandoned lot near the castle? It’s got plenty of space, and it rarely gets visitors. No, that place isn’t so secret anymore ever since the other trees around it got cut down and replaced with a local barracks. The remaining foliage hasn’t fully regrown either. If I start boxing there, rumors of ‘the lot-lout-who-looks-like-that-one-crippled-bookworm-prince punching at air’ would spread, and I’d never hear the end of it.*   

“By the seven, there’s a lot of risks involved no matter where I go to practice here…”  

Just as he sank deeper into the water…  

*“That’s what makes it ambitious, Jerry\!”*  

Shenael’s words echoed into his chest.  

“Ambitious, eh?” he muttered. “Where could I go that's more ambitious…?”  

Then–  

*Wait…there is a place that might work.*

<br>
<br>

Gehenna woke up with a fresh start and stretched her arms.   

She got out of her soft bed and parted the black curtains on all the windows to her right.  

A smile formed on her raw lips as raw sunlight flashed before her. The way it shone brightly today at this time of the year was enough to know she had woken up on time. A little later than usual, but still on time.  

“Lady Gehenna?” a maid said while knocking on the door.  

“Yes, I am awake. What is it?” she immediately replied.  

“You’re expected on the training grounds later today, along with your brethren. Would you like to have your breakfast served here before you go?”  

“Oh, there’s no need for that. I’ll come to the dining hall after I’m ready.”  

“Very well then. Enjoy the rest of your day, Lady Gehenna.”  

“Thank you very much.”  

As the maid walked off, Gehenna immediately walked over to the large closet in a corner of her room and pulled out the thin black coat she usually wore over her frilly nightgown. Then she pulled out her full training gear from there: a dark maroon suit with a steel plate as a vest and thick pants. She checked herself out in the mirror and formulated a plan on her appearance for the day.  

*Today’s likely going to be a day where I sweat myself into oblivion, so I won’t get carried away this time like with yesterday’s dinner. For now, I’ll just polish my hair. The sun’s especially bright, so the shine it’ll give off could help in a spar later.*  

She grabbed a small bag of her essentials on the cabinet before departing. On her way out, she saw her twin brother closing the door behind his room, and they noticed each other right away. She could tell from his damp hair that he recently got out of the bath. The red tunic, black pants, and satchel he wore were nothing she hadn’t seen before.  

*It’s rare of him to be ready for the day this early, and before me, too. That fresh look of his shows potential, but he still isn’t taking advantage of it. I’ll have to find some time later today or this week to help him shop for clothes that’ll make him look better.*  

“Good morning, dear brother,” she greeted with a practiced smile. “Glad to see you’re looking much better than yesterday.”   

“Morning.” he mumbled, unable to change his glum expression.   

*Still unreadable. He avoids these conversations, but I can never tell why. Maybe he’s still rattled from climbing the watchtower yesterday.*  

“We’re all expected to arrive at the training grounds today. Are you coming along too?”  

“No…” His gaze wandered off to the side in search of how to respond. “No one told me to come. I’m…exempt.”  

“Exempt? Why would they still make you exempt, even after all this time?”  

“...Why do you *think* they would?” His voice sharpened as it lowered.  

*Wrong question to ask, Gehenna.*   

She already knew the answer, but holding a conversation with her twin was never easy.   

Nothing else came to mind.  

An awkward silence permeated as they stood idle in the hallway. Gehenna studied his face for any changes, but he struggled to reciprocate her attention with eye contact.  

“Er, well…I'm sure Father and Mother will find something for you soon\! They may be traditional about their ways, but I’ve seen them recognize potential. And you did climb that watchtower, after all\!”  

She cleared her throat as a means of pivoting.  

“In any case, I've been thinking of a few plans for us. If you're able to wait a moment for me to get ready, then we could have breakfast together, along with the rest of our brethren. Or perhaps when I'm done with training, we could go out into town and shop for new clothes. Last time I checked, there was a coat that would suit you perfectly\! What do you say?”  

Gerwyn's eyes contained an unusual glint of determination as she suddenly met them.  

“Can’t do either, I'm busy.” he said as he walked past her.  

She noticed an average-sized book in his right hand, but the way he gripped it prevented her from seeing the cover.   

As he disappeared into the hallway, she could only give a disheartened shrug.  

*Several years ago, he would have said yes. What changed between us?*  

She made her way inside the nearby private bath and began filling up the tub.   

Her thoughts drifted back to that look on his face.  

*And I’ve never seen that spark in his eyes before. Was that…ambition?*

<br>
<br>

Gerwyn looked back, then breathed a sigh of relief.   

The escape plan was obviously a desperate one, but that didn’t matter.  

Anything was better than being stuck in such a pointless conversation.  

Anything was better than being frozen in that uncomfortable stillness.  

Anything was better than seeing *It* again.  

*She’ll take a lot longer than a moment to bathe and prepare herself. I’d rather not idle by the door for that long. Even if she changed quickly, I’m not eating with her. That means talking.*  

It wasn’t long before he saw the gargantuan front door leading outside the castle.  

*Also, I know for a fact that the coat she was talking about is a pricey one I’d stick out like a sore thumb in.*   

He fixed a button on his tunic before anyone passing by could notice it loose.  

*I’m not wearing something like that when what I’ve got is enough to get the job done.*   

Right after knocking on the front door, the two guards outside opened it.   

*Especially a job where I’ll get my hands dirty.*   

The glare of the spring sun shone down on him as he walked out of the castle.  

*No, I can’t call this path I started on a job. It’s more like an adventure. And…*  

The air tasted fresh and the melted puddles of snow gave the world a glistening shine.  

*“Today’s adventure is gonna be more ambitious\!”*  

“Today’s adventure is gonna be more ambitious,” he echoed Shenael with a whisper.

<br>
<br>

The clanging of wooden swords was the first thing Gehenna heard when she made it to the courtyard.   

By the time she saw them, Victor and Lily had finished a sparring match. The latter lay sprawled on the training floor’s marble pavement while catching her breath. The former wiped the sweat from his brow and gave his hefty practice sword a triumphant flourish.   

*I know it comes from daily practice, but it’s insane how he swings that with such ease.*  

Lily was the first of the two to notice Gehenna’s arrival.  

“Oh, good morning, big sis\!” she said with a bright grin.  

“You…are late again.” Victor stated flatly, holding his sword point-down.   

“Good morning to you too, dearest Lily.” she said sweetly, before shooting a side glance at Victor. “And no, I am not late this time; you two started an hour early. There’s a difference.”  

“Greater trials equal greater demands. Such was the lesson to be learned from yesterday.”  

“No one said that last night.” a dry voice called from near the side benches.   

Gehenna was startled. She had no idea Nadis was observing from the sidelines.  

*How does she always remain unnoticed like that? And without magic?*   

The glare in her eyes compelled Victor to avert his gaze, now filled with sorrow and contemplation, at the ground.  

*Odd, he’d usually give a lofty speech after that. It’s possible something happened between those two and Georg after I left the dining room…perhaps I should have eavesdropped after all.*  

“And besides,” Pendra yawned as he and Mercer entered the grounds. “Waking up earlier than this is the trial.”  

He stretched and flexed his arms around.  

“Today’s a good day outside, let’s take our time with it.”  

*If I’m late by Victor’s standards, what does that make these two, then?*  

“Oh, we’ll take our time here, alright.” Mercer remarked. “Today’s going to be a different story from yesterday.”  

“Yeah, a different story where you take home one win today instead of the usual zero.” Lily smugly quipped.  

Without hesitation, Mercer swiftly kicked her away by a few meters.  

“Owww\!” Lily yelped as she rolled on the floor.  

“Oh, grow up, you *spoiled little shit*. You’re not in pain, I kicked you with the top of my foot. *Godsdamn* drama queen.” he said with a fresh morning ire.   

The wind hissed as Victor’s blade flashed near Mercer’s throat.   

“Try that again,” he warned, “and see what happens.”   

Mercer did not respond with a flinch, but a glare.  

From the belt, he pulled out his weapon of choice: a stick and a weighted ball connected by a long chain.   

“I’ll see, alright. Get ready, *commander*, ‘cause this time, I won’t stop until your skull’s a pancake.”  

*And off goes the sourpuss.*   

Gehenna helped her up on her feet and dusted off her shoulders.  

“Are you alright, Lily?” Gehenna asked.  

Lily nodded, then opened her mouth to call Mercer out, but Gehenna put a finger to her mouth as a quiet gesture of silence. Upon seeing the two scowling brothers stare each other down as they took their stances, Lily understood right away, and the two sisters walked to the bench near Nadis. Pendra soon followed.   

Gehenna took the left end of the bench. Lily dropped into the middle with a relaxed sigh, and Pendra slouched on the right, face propped on one arm.  

With a single crack between wood and weight, the duel began. 

<br>
<br>

Ashwright’s District B was packed – too packed, even for a good morning. Market stalls spilled into the street, shouting voices tangling together into indecipherable noise. Gerwyn felt overwhelmed by the crowd all around him as he scanned the stalls that came in for today.   

*Even considering the current spring is a good season for travelers to visit, this street’s the busiest it's been in a while. Getting through this crowd could be tricky, since my main goal here is to draw no unnecessary attention.*   

The different smells of cooking pots and furnaces from food stalls galore became more profound the further he walked into the crowd. As they wafted into his nose, his stomach began to growl in a way he hadn’t heard in some time. He pulled an apple wrapped in cloth out of his satchel and contemplated it for a moment.  

*This isn’t going to be enough. I don’t eat much for breakfast, but…might as well get something else here.*  

He put the apple back in and started looking around more carefully. Having little preference made it hard to choose what to eat among the tempting glimpses of unfamiliar delicacies.  

“Hey, you\! Could I interest you in a mornin’ wich?” a cheerful voice called out.  

Instinctively, Gerwyn turned to his right in response. The one who called that out was a portly middle-aged woman with a wide grin, a humble wooden table in front of her, and two pans hanging over a small fire in the back. He then looked to his left to see if the woman was talking to someone else, then looked back at her.  

“Yes, you, the young lady there\!” she shouted with a laugh, pointing at him. “Ya seem like you could use a mornin’ wich right now\!” She tapped the sheet of paper on her table. “Menu’s right here\!”  

*…Not this again. How do people still mistake me for a girl?*  

Gerwyn frowned as he walked towards the table and saw the menu up close. It was one piece of parchment written in common, thick ink.

<br>

<p class="center bold">BETHANY’S MORNIN’ WICHES</p>

<p class="center bold">Egg ‘n Ham Wich - 5G</p>

<p class="center bold">Egg ‘n Lamb Wich - 5.50G</p>

<p class="center bold">Egg ‘n Veg Wich - 4.50G</p>

<p class="center bold">Add cheese for 1.50G</p>

<br>

*Good, there’s not many to choose from, so this will be quick. The prices are reasonable, so I can take one for breakfast and save another for lunch. What’s with the names, though?*  

“Um…I’ll take…” he spoke cautiously. “Two sandwiches. One ham and the other…veg.”  

Right after hearing his low voice, Bethany squinted. “Hey, wait, you…”  

**THUMP.**  

*It* appeared in her stare for a moment.  

*Wait, does she already know who I am? Damn it, of course she would\! I should have just kept walking; why did I have to stop and gawk at her like a fool\!? If she says my name, she’ll catch everyone’s attention here, and they’ll–*  

“*By the seven*, you’re not a girl at all\! You’ve got a boy’s deep voice\! Oh, I’m deeply sorry, lad\! You had that ladylike air the mornin’ shines on, an’ I thought–” she exclaimed while apologetically bowing multiple times. “I didn’t mean anythin’ by it, I was just surprised\!”  

As the heart calmed down, he heaved a breathless sigh.  

*Ok, she doesn’t know. Maybe she does, but isn’t pointing it out. Either way…good.*  

“Anyway\!” Bethany regained her composure by clasping her thick hands together. “One egg ‘n veg an’ one egg ‘n ham, right? Ya want cheese in both?”  

He nodded, then put 11 gold and 2 silvers on the front table.   

She took them with an appreciative grin.  

“Why, thank you\! I’ll get them ready in just a moment\!”  

The way she had tied up her blonde curls and the stains on her apron was a sign she had been through this many times before.   

*When it comes to options for food, less is more.*   

Her hands moved with the ease of long habit—hair tied in a fraying blonde bun, apron marked with a life’s worth of stains. She cracked the eggs with practiced flicks of the wrist, letting them sizzle before adding greens, carrots, and herbs in precise measures.  

*It means she can put more into each of them.*  

A promising aroma wafted from the pans. The two sandwiches were carefully wrapped into folded cloth and handed to him in a small, paper bag.   

“Um…thank you.” He bowed and left the stall.  

“You’re very welcome, lad\! Come back another time\!” she called as she waved.  

Gerwyn glanced down at his sleeves, then at the shape of his arms.  

*Ladylike air, huh? What did I even do that was ladylike? Or…*  

He held up the right hand and turned it over.  

*Did she say that because of how frail I look?*  

**THUMP.**  

Thinking of the correlation twisted a rotting knot in his chest.   

Holding it together with the right hand did nothing to stop the nauseating pain.  

Hoping it would provide some form of reprieve, he took the egg and ham sandwich out from the bag and unwrapped the cloth.  

The steaming warmth and the glistening of the egg inside was enough to ease his spirit.   

He breathed it in.  

*Choosing to live yesterday didn’t fix anything; it was never going to. Living means I’ll still see It everywhere in this forsaken kingdom.*  

Holding the ‘wich’ with one hand, he bit into it. Its mixture of egg and ham held by melted gouda and wrapped in whole grain bread was unusually more potent in flavor than he’d expect from such a simple recipe. As the comforting warmth spread through his body, the crowds around him felt less suffocating.  

*At least I lived long enough to taste a good sandwich.*

<br>
<br>

Mercer’s long ranged fighting style clashed against Victor’s simple yet effective gameplan. The rugged sourpuss overwhelmed the grounds with precise strike after strike to keep at bay, and the commander deflected each swing with a drive equal in might. An occasional hit would stagger Victor and debilitate him from the pure impact, but he never let the weakness show on his face.  

*I’ll admit, Mercer’s done more than enough to prove his brains. His reflexes and understanding of ranges do make him unworthy of a losing streak. With better mentoring, that potential could carry him even farther than Pendra and Lily.*  

Gehenna’s brief admiration did not stop her from letting out a bored yawn.  

*That being said, there’s little else to take away from here. I’ve seen this play out before.*   

Pendra yawned along with her. His lackadaisical expression was enough to tell he shared a similar sentiment.  

“What’s with you two this morning?” Lily inquired. “You’re both already tired, and we haven't been here long.”  

“Oh, we’re not tired.” Pendra grinned. “Yawning is something one does when they feel a premonition of another…*unambitious* day to come. Another day where nothing changes.”  

“Really?” She tilted her head.   

“Yep\! According to a book I recently found in the archives, the human brain is well known for its ability to adapt to nearly anything. That means if you ingrain the right magic–”  

“He’s spouting verbose hogwash to make his magic theory seem more impressive, Lily.” Gehenna sighed. “I sincerely doubt the ability to predict moves with the wind and earth extends to the concept of fate, as that would require a wholly different application of elements. And he hasn’t visited the archives in 6 months, either. Ignore him.”   

Pendra straightened up on the bench, mock-wounded. “Aw, come on, Gehenna, it wouldn’t hurt for you to play along here. What’s wrong with lying to your little brother and sister every now and then?”  

*Nothing in particular; there's simply too little worth lying about.*  

“Everything’s wrong with that, Penny\!” Lily protested. “It’s already bad enough that you’re always unfunny, but I could never live with big sis Gehenna and you teaming up\! Why do you keep lying with your hogwash to act like you’re better than me?”  

“I dunno, *kiddo*; why do you always fall for it? You looked a little too interested in my ‘hogwash’.” Pendra snickered.  

“*Why, you*…” she seethed.   

He waved his fingers with both thumbs in the ears and goofily stuck his tongue out, prompting her to clench her fist and pout.  

“Nothing changes, indeed…” Nadis murmured, the weight of her words heard only by Gehenna.  

*She’s acting odd, too. It’s unlike her to give passive remarks.*  

Gehenna patted Lily’s head to calm her down. “It’s too early to start an argument, you two. That being said…” She redirected her attention back to the duel. Almost ten minutes had passed, and neither side had cornered the other.   

“You’re not wrong this day being another lackluster one, Pendra. I predict they’ll be at that stalemate for ten more minutes.”  

“You make it sound like a generous judgement there,” he remarked.  

“That’s because it is. Without any generosity, it’ll be twenty minutes.”  

“And what makes you so sure?”  

Mercer landed three brutal strikes past Victor’s sword, but the commander kept swinging, undeterred.  

“This looks less like a duel between warriors and more like a never-ending ballgame at a pitiful circus. We’re watching two slaves to their own worlds throwing their combat preferences at each other, with no desire to deviate. At this rate, they’ll have less survivability than the Ashen Highlands’ wildlife; those untamed beasts hold a superior understanding of adapta–”  

**CLANG.**  

Gehenna's knife flashed as she parried the ball of Mercer’s weapon in time.  

“...tion.”  

Mid-duel, he let the chain fly wild behind him – faking a slip.   

The raw force behind this “slip” was enough to know it was aimed at her from the start.  

*If I deflected that wrong, a broken wrist would be my reward.*  

Nobody bought the act, and he didn’t bother doubling down on it. The vicious stare he gave to her said as much. Her only response was a glare just as deadly.  

*What a sick joke of the seven gods, to make this wretch older than me.*  

“Hey\!” Lily protested.  

“Mercer\!” Victor barked. “Enough of your–”  

The moment he averted his eyes to Gehenna was all Mercer needed.  

With the ball’s remaining momentum, he flung it directly at the commander’s right kneecap. As he staggered and let out a gasp, Mercer ran right behind and wrapped the chain around his neck. He desperately gripped the chain as the air got choked out of him, but the sourpuss’s tenacity would not allow for such attempts at escape.  

Eventually, Victor fell and tapped his hand on the floor to surrender.  

As soon as Mercer noticed, he stood on top of Victor’s body and took a deep breath.  

“*Grrraaaaahhhhhh*\!\!\!\!\! Finally took this bastard down\!\! How’s that for an *unambitious circus act*, you pompous *whore*\!\!?” he roared at the top of his lungs.  

Gehenna stood up and clapped at a sarcastically slow pace. “Yes, bravo, *bravo*. Mercer took down the *big bad* commander.” she drawled with a dry overtone. “You’ve made your case clear; now do us all a favor and take a *sedative* already.”  

“I’ll take a *sedative* when you die of ‘unknown causes,’ *bitch*.” he spat as he walked off Victor's body.  

*Whatever, mongrel.*  

Pendra inserted himself into the conversation. “While we're still talking about *sedatives*, let's hand one to our beloved commander after today's training. He’s the main star of the Ashwright family circus, and we wouldn't want him dying to the pressure.”  

“If you have time to feel *concern* for your enemy,” Victor declared as he got up and dusted himself off. “Perhaps you have time to *fight* your enemy, Pendra Ashwright.”   

Without hesitation, he stood to accept the challenge. “Alright, alright, I’m coming\!”  

He tied his messy hair into a ponytail, and slicked the remaining bangs away from the eyes. A wide grin was all over his face as he unlatched a wooden axe from the belt.  

“I can’t choke you out, but…” He slashed the air with a series of precise flourishes. “You should still be careful. I know a thing or three about knocking someone out with this.”  

Victor’s only response was to take his two-handed stance again. Their duel began.  

Mercer folded his arms and took the empty seat on the bench.   

“Mercer\!” Lily immediately said as he sat down. “We all know what you were trying to do back there with that ‘accident’\! I know big sis and you don’t get along at all, but you could at least try not to kill her during a spar\!”  

“I appreciate it, dearest Lily, but there's no need to get so worked up. I’m perfectly fine, see?” Gehenna reassured as she examined her wrist. “After being away from daily practice for two weeks, that ‘accident’ of his was a good exercise to get back into the rhythm of things.”   

“It wasn’t to help you,” he replied. “That unscathed hand is proof I didn’t strike hard enough.”  

*More like proof you’re stagnating.*  

“Gods, why are you always like this\!?” Lily protested in indignation. “Can’t you just calm down and apologize for everything you’ve said\!?”  

“No.”   

“Wha–\!? What do you mean, ‘no’? She’s your sister\!”  

“Unfortunately.” he and Gehenna both said in unison.   

They gave each other a surprised look, then immediately turned their heads away. Lily’s perplexed gaze darted between the two, unsure of what to say to defuse the tension. She looked to Nadis for an answer, but the second oldest simply shook her head in quiet resignation.  

They turned their focus back on the duel.   

Pendra was having far too much fun agitating Victor by dodging each of his swings with a gleeful smirk and a loose stride.  

“Take this seriously, Pendra\! Do not treat the battlefield as a ballroom\!” Victor ordered.  

“Hey hey, didn’t I tell you already, Vic? Let’s take our time here\!” Pendra replied with unfazed cockiness. “The weather’s nice for once\! It's not everyday we get to have a ballgame at an outdoor circus\!”   

“This\! Is\! Not\!\! A\!\! Circus\!\!\!” he roared as his swings got faster.  

*Yet another stalemate. Is it really necessary to tire him out like that, Pendra? Or does that dream of being an adventurer involve you claiming the legendary title of ‘The Hero who Wins All Bouts by Prancing Everywhere’?*  

“So, um…” Lily mumbled, nervously kicking her feet and trying to revive the mood.  

“What is it, dearest Lily?” Gehenna asked.  

“Oh, it’s just…the sun’s bright and we’re still missing two. Where are they, big sis?”  

“I wouldn’t know about Georg, I didn’t see him this morning.” Gehenna turned to Nadis. “Did you?”  

“Yes. He’ll be joining us in the afternoon.” Nadis answered. “After coming back here so suddenly, he still has much more to explain to our parents.”  

“Didn’t he already explain his travels last night?” Lily tilted her head.  

“He explained the ‘fun’ parts easily said at the table. Today, it’s the serious parts that belong *away* from the table. There’s a time and place for every topic, after all.”  

“Tell that to our fuming commander there.” Gehenna remarked.  

“...I tried.”  

Her weary eyes told Gehenna the rest of the tale.  

*And it didn’t work out. Nothing changes, indeed…*  

“Well, that makes sense.” Lily spoke up. “But what about…*him*? You definitely saw where *he* went off to, right, big sis?”  

“...If you speak of Gerwyn, then yes, I did see him.” Gehenna answered. “He was ready early, too. Though…when I tried to invite him along for breakfast, he gave a rather…*determined* look I’ve never seen before. Then he said ‘I’m busy’ and walked off without a word.”  

Mercer scoffed dryly. “And I’m secretly a sage-lord who turned *Kaos* into a paradise.”   

“That’s one lousy excuse if I’ve ever heard one\! If you’re going to lie, at least do a better job\!” Lily shouted.   

She looked around at her siblings for affirmation, but received nothing.   

To her, this was a sign to continue.   

“‘I’m busy’, he says. Yeah, right. What could he be so *busy* with, anyway\!?”

Gerwyn was busy climbing the watchtower.  

The careful walk up the small steps made of dilapidated stone felt more treacherous on the second ascension. Age had not been kind recently to its structure – some stones felt looser under his shoes while others had crumbled away long ago.  

He reached the first of five checkpoints.   

Each checkpoint had a rusted door on the left and a window on the right.  

Gerwyn had already seen what was behind all five doors: emptiness caked by dust and moss. The only signs of history left were chains long rusted and the smell of ancient rot. If there were any skeletons who once lived there, they had either decayed or been relocated to an unmarked grave.  

Each window was obfuscated by old grime and unwashed stains. He could barely see anything outside except for the sunlight.  

Nadis’s words from last night flashed back as he looked back at his progress so far.  

*“Even veterans need to be meticulous around the short steps and lack of rails.”*  

He blinked a few times to make sure the dark stones further up were no trick of the mind.  

*It’s not just the steps. Even on a sunny day, it’s too dark to clearly see here.*  

The windows of this tower were scarce in number, and the light they let in was not enough to quell the tower’s oppressive shadows. The stale air made each breath in the darkness feel like inhaling the presence of a wraith’s breath.   

It was no wonder the Ashfolk cloaked this place in superstition.   

The deafening silence and darkness turned it into an abyss that went upwards.  

*How did I even ascend this the first time without fear?*   

He resumed the journey on the stairs, letting his thoughts wander as he clutched a rusted rail and kept an eye on the steps.  

*Did I really want to die that badly?*  

The rail supporting him had gone filthy and frail from stagnation.   

Its reliability was long gone, but some sliver of security was better than none.  

*Do I still want to die?*  

His shoulder brushed past another door, indicating he had reached the second checkpoint before even realizing it.  

*No. But I still don’t feel like living.*   

The only noise to accompany him were the quiet taps of his shoes.  

*First, there was that survival instinct that refused to let me die. Then there was that fork, and now…Knuckle Duster.*  

He stopped briefly at the third checkpoint and looked out an even filthier window. Upon feeling it, he noticed his hand was shaking from the dread in the darkness.  

*I’ve seen this play out before, and every time, it’s led to a dead end.*  

The short break did little to appease the shaking, but his aching legs moved up anyways.  

*So why do I keep walking?*  

The darkness grew heavier with each step towards ascension.  

*Is it because…there’s a part of me that can’t stand giving up before reaching the dead end? Or is walking towards them all I’m ever–*  

***CRACK.***  

One step gave way beneath his left foot.   

**THUMP.**  

He staggered back on instinct just before the stone broke off and tumbled into the void.  

**THUMP.**  

Brief panic set in as Gerwyn came back to his senses and realized what happened.  

**THUMP.**  

Had he not followed instinct, he likely would have fallen with the rubble.  

Out of self-reproach, he harshly tapped his right fist against the forehead.  

*Now’s not the time to think that, you foolish wretch. Each step here is a gamble between life and death. Your only concern right now is to see which steps will preserve your life and which ones lead to your death. Once you ascend to the balcony, everything else comes after.*  

He progressed at a slower pace, eyes locked onto the stairs.   

The barely visible levels below and the darkness looming above did not matter anymore.  

After too many steps to count, he reached the top floor.   

The door to the balcony was once again near his grasp.   

His hands dropped to his sore knees to catch some breaths.  

“*Whew*…finally…made…it…”  

He rubbed his forehead for a moment to refresh the spirit.   

Intense concentration on a path he could barely see had drained him.  

*I need to get used to this tower. This won’t be the last time I’ll climb it.*  

He dusted off a shoulder and checked his stable pulse.   

*Alright, my first trial today is over. I’ll take a break outside, then start boxing practice.*  

Fully composed, his hand immediately reached for the doorknob and turned it. He slowly followed the knob as he opened it, knowing the rustic door leading outside could break down if handled too roughly.   

The cool breeze and the shining sun came back in full force when the door let them in.   

The air released him from the climb’s suffocating dread.   

As he kept himself close to the door when it shut–  

“Oh, hello there.”  

**THUMP.**  

The voice of the last person he wanted to see gave his body the violent urge to collapse.  

It took every part of his mind to hold it together.  

His vision blurred, fearful of looking at the one who climbed before him.  

Running back down the treacherous stairs veterans struggled with was not an option.  

Gerwyn had no choice but to face him.   

**THUMP.**  

The man stood on the other side of the balcony, tall and backlit by the sun.  

Cloaked in deep black and a tunic of deep navy, with trousers the shade of dried blood.  

His long silhouette held a more oppressive air than the watchtower.  

*It* festered in his shadow.  

“You’ve been full of surprises lately.”  

**THUMP.**  

“Didn’t think you’d come here a second time, *little brother*.”  

*Georg.*
