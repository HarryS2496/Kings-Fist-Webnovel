<h3>742, 27th of Quinedre</h3>

“Come on, Jerry, where’s your sense of adventure? We’ve got a tunnel to dig\!\!”

Two children of differing royalty hiked along Ashwright’s main road to an adventure they would never forget.  

Shenael Lunendra carried a large shovel by the handle in one hand and dragged a reluctant Gerwyn Ashwright by the arm with the other.

“Alright, alright, I’ll come along; just quit dragging me around already\! People are watching\!” he insisted. 

She let go of his arm and stopped, letting him catch his breath. 

*Why’s he always holding his chest like that? It can’t be that hard to carry these shovels.*  

“So you’re not gonna run, then?” she asked with a hint of suspicion.  

“No no, I’m not, I promise. It’s just…”  

He got his bearings together with one last deep breath.  

“Are you sure you want to do this? There’s a lot of risks here, and I don’t have a solution for all of them.” He ran a hand through his crimson-orange locks as they began to walk side by side.  

“Didn’t I tell you already? That’s what makes this one ambitious\!” Shenael beamed with her wolfish grin.  

“Okay, how about this, then?” Gerwyn began to count the issues with his free hand. “We need to get past the gate guards, find a good excuse for why two little kids would have business outside this city, and then find some place we can dig a hole into without being spotted–”  

“We’re not digging a hole; we’re digging a tunnel\! A tunnel\! From here to Xaede\!” she loudly corrected.  

“And that’s another thing\!” he snapped back after uncovering one of his ears. “Digging that kind of tunnel would take a whole squadron months to complete and polish, even if they were working day and night\! What makes you think us two will be able to match that?”  

“Uh…well…”  

*Darn, that’s actually a good point. But I already bought these shovels with the money Mother gave, so it’s too late to back down now\!*  

“We’ve just gotta keep up with them, then\! My grandpa once said anything’s possible when you set your mind straight to it\!”  

“Wow, sounds like you’ve had this *ambitious adventure* carefully laid out, *Your Majesty*.” Gerwyn dryly remarked.  

“Hey, shuddup, you egghead\! This’ll do more for our muscles than that book about the ‘cimbrulesce artrey’ ever will\!”  

“It’s called the ‘circumflex artery’, and we shouldn’t have left that book behind\!” Gerwyn was quick to correct her this time as he looked back. “I need to return that to the archives once I’m done.”  

“Don’t be such a worrier, Jerry. Nobody goes into that lot we use, you can get it after we’re done for the day.” she reassured him. “More importantly…”  

The two approached the southern gate of Ashwright, the wall that stood between them and the outside world.  

“I know these guards will let us through, no matter what. Even a knight of Ashwright can’t resist the charms of a cute girl like me\!” she grinned while flicking back some of her hair.  

Gerwyn squinted and stared at his best friend, a princess carrying a big shovel, with discontent apprehension. “Ehhh…”  

*This little–\!\!*  

“Hey, don’t ‘ehh’ me with that look\! People’s heads always turn when there’s a pretty elf around\! That’s what my Grandpa always says\!” she shouted.  

“Your grandpa sure says some bizarre things, alright…” he mumbled.  

A grand door of steel and wood under watch by two guards was the first of their hurdles to overcome on this adventure.  

“And where might you two children be heading to?” the guard on the left said with a tone callous enough to catch both of them off guard.  

*He's scary! What do these knights eat to look like that?*   

Shenael looked down and back at the guard on the left, a tall and broad man with a face only found on chiseled stone. “Um, well, we’re going outside to dig for…um…”  

“Treasure\! We’re, uh, digging for treasure outside the walls\!” Gerwyn quickly interjected.   

“...Treasure right outside our gates, you say?” the guard replied without curiosity.  

“Yes, that’s correct. We heard a rumor going around about gold not far from these walls, and decided to investigate it before anyone else does.”  

“Interesting you say that, because I’ve heard of no such thing, little one.” the callous guard replied as he adjusted his gauntlets. “Perhaps you should run back before you and the knife-eared lass get yourselves into danger.”  

Before Shenael could fire back, Gerwyn quickly put a finger to his clenched teeth. Right when she got the message, he continued.  

“I never said we believed it to be true. We just need to see whether or not it is.”  

“You kids have much to learn if you think the both of you are enough to debunk something ridiculous like–”  

“Tarcus, let them go.” said the guard on the right.   

Though Shenael was at first unsure because of her equally broad build, the rough tones of her voice were enough to tell she was a woman of higher experience at her post.  

“Are you sure, Helgra?” the guard named Tarcus turned his head to her. “It’s not going to look good on us if we just let two children wander off from here.”  

“It’s because they’re children that they should be allowed to wander every now and then. They won’t get many chances to play like that in the future.” the other guard named Helgra said with certainty. “‘Sides, the lad’s got a way with words and the lass is an elf; that’s enough to see they won’t stay out too late.”  

Tarcus looked back at the two children, then sighed and scratched the back of his helmet. “S’pose that’s fair enough. Righto, go on ahead, but not too far.”   

The two guards proceeded to push open the large door. Shenael felt wonder surge back into her as the winds and the sunshine of the land outside Ashwright burst into the kingdom’s entrance. When she and Gerwyn turned to leave, Tarcus stopped the latter with a gentle hand on the shoulder.  

“Oh, and you, lad. Shoveling’s a man’s job first. So don’t think of letting the lady do all the work for your ‘treasure hunting’, alright?”  

“I…uh, wasn’t going to? Why else would I carry my own shovel?” Gerwyn asked, unwilling to humor the guard for a second longer.  

“Better keep carrying it, you little wordsmith. Now get going before one of us changes our mind.”  

Shenael looked back to see the eggheaded prince sneaking an unnerved look at the guard as he slowly followed her.  

“Come on, come on, Jerry, you’ve gotta see all of this\!” Shenael excitedly urged him along.  

The two children stepped forward into the outside lands, slowly engulfed by the sun’s light when–

<h3>750, 5th of Quadedre</h3>

As the sunshine of reality burned away the dream, Shenael awakened.  

She groggily rose up and rubbed her eyes, then stretched her arms as a yawn escaped her.  

“Ugh…”  

*Another dream about the past, huh? Those sure were the days…*  

As her vision became clear, she looked to the window on the right side of her room, where the sun shone brightly.  

*And they still feel like a week ago.*  

She adjusted her underwear below her long, white shirt with one hand and quelled a small itch on her back with another. Yesterday's training routine still ached in her bones.  

*What time is it right now? I better not have overslept…*  

“Shen, dear?” her mother, Kathenael, called from beyond the door. “Are you awake?”  

“Uh, yeah…” Shenael called out before yawning again.   

“You’ve been summoned for a meeting at The Nexus.”  

…*Oh, shit\!\!*  

Her mind blazed awake, scattering the enervation.

*Right, that is today, can’t believe I almost forgot\!*  

“Is everything all right in there?” Kathenael said as she opened the door.  

“Yeah, no problems here, Mom, I just woke up\! Am I short on time to arrive? Can I still make it there without trouble?” she asked while quickly putting on a coat and getting her bearings together.  

“No need to fret, my dear. Your father and grandfather left not too long ago; the meeting starts in about an hour.”  

Shenael sighed in relief. “I’ll be there as soon as possible, then. Don’t worry about breakfast, I’ll make do with something in town\!”  

“Okay, then\! Be careful on your way there, dear Shen\!” her mother called as she left to head back downstairs.  

*Good, I still have time. Can’t let them think you’re slacking this early on, Shenael\!*  

Swift preparations were but another forte ingrained into her spirit.   

She rummaged through her closet and found the dress most councilwomen wore for circumstances such as her: an elegant dress of white with gold outlines and a black flower ingrained into its back. Though it hid her physique behind the thickness of the fabric, it granted a modest freedom to let her legs run.  

Within ten minutes, she had already put on the dress under her black coat, and affixed her hair into the short, straight locks of silver and grey her people saw her as. She shoved a spare change of her favorite clothes into her satchel; a gray shirt with golden lines, pants of black leather, and fingerless gloves tinted with maroon.  

“Bye, Mother\!” she said as she rushed straight out of the house and on the path she knew like the back of her palms.   

The path stretched from their secluded house to the centerpiece that stood below the earth and pierced the sky.  

The Nexus.  

Despite the constricts on her legs that came with the dress she wore, Shenael’s pace did not falter. What may have taken twenty minutes for one going on a casual stroll, she cleared in less than ten with a run.   

When the Nexus entered her sight, she slowed down to a stop and brushed the back of her dress. Though the sun had only just shone, many early risers were also on their way to the tower, and taking their time on the pathway there.   

As she slowed her pace down and fixed her hair, the Nexus leered with every step.  

*Mother’s right, there’s no need to fret here.*   

She took a deep breath once she opened the doors of marble and obsidian.  

*You’ve done this before.*  

The halls were quiet, save for some maids running around to clean the halls.   

Shenael made sure to wave at them as she usually did, holding them in the highest respect for their dedication to spotlessness. Though some recognized her later than others, they bowed in her presence.   

*Maybe it is better I wake up earlier, this place feels more serene than usual.*  

Upon stepping into the central elevator of the Nexus, a panel of runic flames burst in front of her. She instinctively tapped the flame depicting the lowest level.  

Apprehension came and went in waves as the platform’s descent brought her closer to where she needed to be.   

The Round Table of the Sages. 

<br>
<br>

An hour later, the meeting at the round table commenced.   

“Little time has passed since the last gathering here, yet we have much to discuss,” said her father, Sage of Light Crideas. “Though our kingdom’s days continue with seldom malcontent, the same cannot be said for the rest of Axiom.”  

Shenael sat to the right side of Crideas, while her grandfather, Rueltabre, sat to his left. The other seven sages were seated evenly across the round table. Though the seating arrangements were not a concern to any of the Sages, none dared to take each other’s spots.   

*Honestly, it’s still hard to keep track of everyone here.*  

“Aye, Crideas; our last was too idle for its own good. This time, we must strike at the heart, bar none.” said Sage of Dark Icarr Ledhess as he adjusted his eyepatch. “I’ll start with the first dagger; how long will our neutrality last?”  

“Not sharp enough.” commented Sage of Light Annae Niannes. She took a sip of her favorite tea and smacked her lips before continuing. “We’ve been neutral to conflict aplenty for so long, you can’t spell this country without–”   

“There is no N in Xaede, girl.” Sage of Dark Solinde Kurnael curtly interrupted.  

“For Zaiklonael’s sake, Master Solinde, it’s called a joke. You should use those more for the sake of your digestion.” told Sage of Light Mennae Niannes. She too sipped her tea, but favored it less.   

“And these ‘jokes’ have no place for sharpening the blades of our table.” Solinde snapped as he glared at the Dias twins.   

*What’s with the constant ‘dagger’ metaphors they keep using here? Just say ‘here’s the first topic to discuss’ or something, it’s less complicated to say\!*  

Shenael glanced at Crideas again. Despite his seriousness, Shenael could still spot a tinge of irritation on his face, sharing a similar sentiment to hers.  

“Let’s stay focused before this becomes another idle meeting, fellow Sages.” He raised his hand to silence the room. “I had planned to start this off by asking for any reports on internal issues within this realm, but what Icarr speaks is also of vital importance, so let him proceed.”  

“Thank you, friend.” Icarr smirked as he slouched back in his seat, opposite to Crideas’s. “It’s quite simple, really. Ashwright and Lambda stare each other down once again, and talks of war loom over the horizon once again. As the human nations around us grow more tense, more of us have come to blows with rogues attempting to light the fire. What are we to do about that?”  

To Shenael’s lack of surprise, the entire room fell silent, and none smiled at the question.  

The boy she admired long ago flashed back in her mind.  

*Jerry…*  

One Sage of Dark, an elderly man that Shenael struggled to remember the name of, quickly cut through the tension with his own answer, scratching his elongated beard. “Well, perhaps we could still…continue keeping our neutrality as is. But can we afford to keep that up now?”  

“Personally, I don’t think there’s a right answer to this question,” Mennae said, unwilling to hide her discomfort thinking of an answer. She began holding up three fingers, one at a time as she continued. “To side with Ashwright…to side with Lambda…or to remain still…all three of these knives will cost us dearly, one way or another.”  

“Preferably, I’d like to remain still. But if there’s anything I know about King Sherman and King Hans, it’s that they won’t stop until the other is nothing but pure rubble.” Crideas answered.   

“But they are currently racing to see who can win Zantche’s favor, no?” asked the long-bearded Sage of Dark whose name still eluded Shenael.  

“And yet Zantche still struggles to decide one over the other.” Rueltabre sighed as he softly tapped a finger on the table. “Pity that such a bountiful province carries a legacy of being so wishy-washy.”  

“Such is the curse of a prosperous demesne surrounded by behemoths.” added Crideas, politely regaining control of the table. “Meanwhile, we of Xaede hold too many cards to remain ignored, even as this forest stands by the wayside. It is only a matter of time before both Ashwright and Lambda turn to us for a similar alliance.”   

“Yes, I can already hear King Sherman attempting to remind us of the times we were once allies. That, or he’ll pester us with the practical military costs of both sides.” suspired Mennae.  

“And if…eurgh, *King Hans the Arrogator* were to negotiate with us, he’ll remind us of what Ashwright did to mar our relations as allies.” Annae groaned as she recoiled at the name she uttered.   

“We can certainly agree that siding with Hans of Lambda is the wrongest choice of the lot.” remarked Icarr.  

A series of ayes and nods spread across the round table. An easy opportunity for Annae, the more outspoken of the Niannes twins, to keep going.  

“Ah, good to see you all understand\! We’re certainly not going to side with some king who collects noblewomen like they’re trophies\! Forget bringing up our strained relations with Ashwright, that filthy hedonist will throw in some of his wives and sons as pawns to enchain us\!”  

“Seven alive, sister, cease this talk of King Hans; Lunendra’s successor is shadowing our council. You’ll unnerve her with the rumors about what he does to those ‘wives.’” Mennae demanded as she cringed.  

“I appreciate the sentiment, but it’s fine, Master Mennae.” Shenael reassured her. “Er, if I may, there’s something I too wish to say regarding this matter.”  

All eyes turned to her. A situation she still felt taken aback by, but could still withstand.  

“Regarding the rogues that have appeared recently around our territory, we have to keep them as a separate issue from Ashwright and Lambda. We’ll need to quell those separately while considering which of the two kingdoms is the lesser evil here. Sage Icarr, I understand you likely have your own reservations on that since your daughter was in a squadron assigned to quell one of them.”  

“That I do.” Icarr rolled his neck and leaned forward.  

*Wait, should I be telling him this? Vega came home with grave injuries in a skirmish against those rogues, so I can’t just tell him to not be pissed about that. Ah, well, too late to take it back now.*  

“It isn’t in my business to tell you what to feel, but we need to hold strong. It’s true that we can’t run from an upcoming war between human kingdoms. But to goad us into the war at a faster rate is exactly what they want, and we need all the time we can get to prepare our defenses when that time comes. And, well…”  

Icarr nodded at her statement, signaling with one hand for her to continue.  

“Confident as I am in Xaede’s might, we’re not invincible. Whether we fight against Ashwright or Lambda, it’ll cost us greatly either way. If it did not, there would be no need to discuss this matter at all.”  

“Ah, a sharp point, Lady Shenael.” replied Icarr, smiling as he straightened his posture. “Patience remains the watchword in all possible wars, and we need all the time we can to stay out of the hairs of those two kings before we’re forced into them. Mere rogues will always be mere rogues, no matter whose banner they claim to wave.”  

*Whew, he understands. I should calm down.*  

“Just to confirm…” he casually stated as he folded his hands. “Between the two kingdoms, which do you think would make for a better ally?”  

“The one that isn’t Lambda, of course.” Shenael answered without hesitation. “Between King Hans and the populace that likely respects us far less than Ashwright’s, we shouldn’t even consider a handshake with them, lest we–”  

“And why shouldn’t we consider that?” Solinde briskly interrupted.  

He was the only one at the table who remained still when the rest were in agreement on refusing an alliance with Lambda. The question snapped the Sages out of nodding with Shenael’s explanation, and all eyes were on the Sage of Dark outlandish enough to cut her off.  

“I beg your pardon, Master Solinde?” Shenael quickly regained her composure before the rest could.   

“All of you default to disregarding Lambda, yet it is Ashwright that has wronged us. Why must we bother siding with *them* in a possible war?”  

*Hmm, there’s a lot of answers to this question, but where do I start?*   

“Perhaps it’s because…the risks of siding with Lambda pose greater consequences than what Ashwright has done to us.” she cautiously answered.  

“Such as?”  

“Well, putting aside King Hans and his…uh, policies, Lambda isn’t as familiar with our forests or the cold of the northwest. They’d have to learn how to get used to both if we formed an alliance with them, and from farther away, too. Now, correct me if I’m wrong, but Ashwright would definitely be able to take advantage of that, right?”  

“Indeed they would, Lady Shenael. Ashwright is closer to our forests, and I’ve seen their soldiers use them as training grounds.” answered the long-bearded Sage that Shenael still struggled to remember the name of. “Time is always of the essence, so months mustn't be wasted on educating an ally from scratch.”  

“Cowardice, Remonde. Cowardice.” retorted a scornful Solinde.  

*Oh yeah, that’s what his name was. Sorry I forgot, Remonde.*  

“Hmph, you’re more sour than usual today, Solinde. Is this a matter to trace back to your digestion?” Remonde frowned.  

“Just because Lambda’s king is no better than a delirious primate does not mean their army is of the same intelligence. Propose a deal in secret when the time is ripe, then the rest will follow.”   

“It sounds as if you’re in support of Hans, Solinde.” Annae raised her eyebrow.  

“No, it sounds as if none of you heard me properly.” His voice grew colder. “This is about waiting for *when the time is ripe*. Wait for doubt to cloud Lambda during their staredown against Ashwright, amplify their desperation for more firepower, and propose the deal right as they salivate for one. The goal is to starve them to near oblivion so that they’ll settle for rotting dregs. *That* is what I suggest.”  

Silence. It deafened the room.  

This was not the first they had heard of the tactics brought to the council, and it certainly would not be the last.  

“Well?” asked Solinde, staring directly at Shenael and catching her off guard. “What say you, Lunendra heiress?”  

“Uh…” Shenael started before trailing off.   

*Why’s he still asking me? Is this some test they all planned in advance?*  

She awkwardly glanced at each of the Sages, then to Crideas. His icy frown was enough proof that such was not the case. Both he and Rueltabre remained unfettered by the silence.   

Inspired by their resolve, she turned back to Solinde. “That proposal assumes we can keep that kind of deal a secret from Ashwright, which I imagine is easier said than done. They have the means and enough of a grudge against Lambda to not overlook something like that.”  

“And do you know this much from fact? Or merely *personal bias*?” Solinde glared, immediately silencing Shenael’s argument.  

*Damn it, he’s got me there. What do I–*  

“Speak for yourself, Master Solinde.” Crideas declared, barely hiding his contempt at his senior’s insinuations. “To ally with Lambda in secret requires far too many precautions, each of which Ashwright could intercept without trouble. If such a deal gets made public knowledge in Axiom, we will have far more than two kingdoms to worry about in the long game.”  

“And even if a deal like that were to succeed, King Hans lives by his greed.” Rueltabre added. “I have seen it firsthand; he will not stop at mere allegiance. He’ll demand and demand until our forests become a shell of what they used to be.”  

“I am well aware of that, Elder Master Rueltabre.” Solinde quickly fired back. “But it is these kings that must bend the knee in gratitude for our might, not the other way around.”  

Crideas calmed himself with a long breath before continuing his own rebuttal. “Then you should also be aware that both kings carry too much pride to ever let that happen. And let’s say they are driven to ‘eat our rotting dregs.’ Why starve Lambda over Ashwright?”  

“Because I have not forgotten *that day*, Master Crideas.”  

“...As in the day Ashwright took the Zedrunae from us?”  

“And tried to use them without our consent, *yes*\!” Solinde slammed his fist down in agitation.   

Though Shenael expected this reaction, she still flinched.   

“Have all of you forgotten how they clung to what belonged to us, and all for their little ‘conquest’ against Lambda six years ago?” shouted Solinde. “Far too much bloodshed was drawn over our attempts to get the Zedrunae back\! Time and again, they took advantage of what we have to bolster their own ranks–”  

“So they could protect us as well as we could protect them. It was when they attempted usage of the Zedrunae at the tragedy of the Vanadis Border when those relations became strained. And thus we arrive at a distant standstill with–”  

“A standstill\!? Sherman Ashwright sees us as merely extra pieces for his own game\! You just admitted such yourself\! Yet you wish to throw those notions to the wayside simply out of fear of things Lambda has not done to us\!?”  

“*Yet in recent times*. That is the difference.” Icarr was the one to speak up this time.   

“Meaning *what*?” Though Solinde lowered his voice, his contempt only grew louder.  

“Do not mistake stillness for acceptance, Master Solinde; we fear what Lambda has done long before Ashwright. Mere differences in their worship of the Seven Gods versus ours was enough to fuel contempt. Many have sat upon that throne, and not one of them has extended a hand of camaraderie towards our people.”  

“Eighty years ago, there was King Timaeus IV.”  

“And he was assassinated after one year on the throne. Not another has dared to pick up his mantle.”  

Solinde fell silent at last, but remained ill-content.   

“So then, Sages. To all in favor of going along with Master Solinde’s plan, raise your hand and say ‘aye.’” Crideas concluded.  

No one said a word.  

“Well? What say you, Master Solinde?”   

“This will not be the last time we will discuss this matter, Master Crideas. I can assure you of that.”  

“Eh, don’t look too glum, you’ll get them next time.” reassured Annae.  

“Your patronization is unwelcome here, girl.” he grumbled in residual irritation.  

“Now, for the next order of business.” Crideas clapped his hands once to get the council’s attention. “Master Icarr, I believe you have more to report regarding the state of our militia. How will they fare in the years to come.”  

“Well enough to grant us safety against rogues and beasts alike; we still have no need for any of the Zedrunae. But…”  

Though the meeting continued forward, Shenael’s thoughts were absorbed by the questions left behind. Though she kept her attention in the present, parts of it could not let go of what just happened.

<br>
<br>

*If Grandpa’s saying Lambda's a lost cause, then he’s got a good reason for it. But…*  

Not long after the meeting’s end, Shenael went into a nearby restroom and changed into the shirt and pants in her bag, ready to leave the Nexus.   

*Do I really want to back up Ashwright after all they’ve done to my people?*  

Yet as she washed her face before leaving, the dream’s fragments still stuck to her like pine resin.   

*Or is this just about…him?*  

The face of that human prince still stuck to her like pine resin.  

*Dammit, why do I keep coming back to that?*  

She quickened her walking pace as the Nexus’s southern exit became clear to her.  

In her time as a mere shadow to the Sages, she had practiced this subtle escape as a plan to not bump into any of them by pure coincidence. To do so would mean time wasted on post-meeting chatter she currently had no energy for.   

*Besides, what can I do about it now? It’s not like I could just leave this place and travel all the way to Ashwright just to ‘rescue’ him like a knight does for a princess in those obligatory fables. I’d have way more people to answer to than Mom and Dad for that.*  

Her destination for today was a trip to Talon VI.  

*Just have to put that aside for now. More importantly…*  

**GRRUMBLE.**  

*I’m so hungry, I could eat a horse.*  

The hustle and bustle of Xaede’s downtown shone brightly on this fresh spring day.   

As the leaves and greenery fell to the clean pavement below from the grand oak trees that towered above, the people flocked to market sales of food and apparel alike. However, the flock was not as dense as it was during the last visit.  

It was not uncommon to see people from all walks of life in Talon VI; here was where merchants sold food and wares from whatever was an ‘elsewhere’ one could think of in Axiom. Though Shenael walked through it more than anywhere else in her homeland, it was always the everchanging land she could never wholly know like the back of her hands.   

At least, that’s how it was supposed to be, but…  

*There’s less humans around here than usual these days. It’s like all that tension from humanity is leaking into here.*   

She stared straight up as she kept walking, taking care not to bump into anyone.   

*Ashwright and Lambda, huh…*  

Though the sky was obfuscated by the towering greenery of Xaede’s trees, its fierce light bled through the leaves.   

*No matter what I see and what I hear, it always comes back to those two. No matter how hard we try to remain neutral, we can’t escape from those two. Surely there’s another nation unaffected by…whoa, what’s that smell?*  

The pleasant aroma of spices and the crackling sounds of fire and meat wafted from her left. Two brown brothers of similar age, a merchant and mercenary, stood at a stall with most of its wares sold out.   

*Southeasterners?*   

Urged by the instinct of a grumbling stomach, Shenael followed the smell without a second thought. She breathed a sigh of relief upon feeling the coinpurse inside her right pocket.  

The younger brother, the merchant, wore a short coat of beige with pitch black wraps to cover his chest and stomach. A thick, long skirt, or sarong, as she just remembered it was called, draped his waist and legs in a mix of black with red and white lotus patterns. He worked the last of the lamb and chicken stocked behind him, turning the meat over a clay firebox topped with a metal grate and fed by a low flame beneath. One hand shifted the pieces, dressed in coats of orange and green spices before stabbing them into skewers; another occasionally raised a hand over the makeshift stove to amplify the flames underneath.  

The elder brother, the bodyguard, wore a thick, grey tunic and black leather gear that had collected many tatters and frays from possible battles Shenael did not wish to fathom at the moment. An equally worn maroon cape hung over his leather armor, partially obscuring a sheathed scimitar-like weapon at the small of his back. To an untrained eye, his posture and crossed arms could be mistaken for an exotic statue at a high price. But she could tell from his eyes alone that he was on guard.  

*Don’t blurt anything rude now, Shenael.*   

Before she could greet them, the younger brother beat her to it.  

“Hey there\!” he exclaimed in an accent more subtle than she expected. “Welcome to our wares, the ARKH wares, where we spread our wares from glorious Sri Yajurv and Krish Yajurv to everywhere else in Axiom\! I’m Ardhari and he’s Ramanari, and we Kailash brothers would normally ask what we can do you for. But everything here’s sold out, so I’m just here playing the chef to show our spices before we close up\! Anyways, you want some skewers? It’ll cost you a pinch, but not a painful pinch\!”   

*…Uh, what?*   

The rapid-fire delivery of his words immediately told her the duo had been around for a while. The only words she managed to catch besides their names were “ARKH wares,” “Sri Yajurv and Krish Yajurv,” and “skewers costing a pinch.”  

“I’ll take four of those, then. How much is that?” she asked.   

“10 Gold\! Just hand your coins over to my brother while I get to work\! Oh, and try not to stand too close to the flames unless you want the *amchur* to make you cry, yeah?” Ardhari wiped his oiled hands with a cloth, giving them a brief respite with a quick flex.  

*Nice, that’s cheaper than the usual lunch.*   

Shenael gave the coins to Ramanari. He nodded upon feeling their weight in his hand.   

“It’s not often we see southeasterners here. Hope your stay in Xaede’s been well.” she commented.  

“Eh, we’ve been getting that a lot; most of Axiom up here forgets about the southeast down there.” Ardhari shrugged. “Good thing your lands know charity better than most of them, I’ll tell you that\!”  

“You said you were from…the Yajurv Empire, right? What’s the difference between ‘Sri’ and ‘Krish’ there?”  

“Funny enough, this kingdom reminds me of it a little bit.” he chuckled. “Only instead of an above and below where white and dark elves come and go, it’s the west versus the east of the empire the Khans wrangle on the daily.”  

“And there are no trees to stop the sun’s scorching.” Ramanari added quietly.   

“No kidding, brother\! Never seen any building out there run this tall!\!”  

“Good thing they’re not as wide as the palaces back home.”   

“Eh, palace *singular* in Yajurv. Our land’s not as lucky as the ones further southeast.” Ardhari shrugged. “But that’s not as important as the other question; Rama, what *is* the difference between Sri and Krish?”  

“...Sri’s the west for the lightskinned and Krish’s the east for the darkskinned. We sell things from both sides, and…well…” Ramanari sighed as he ruffled his head, disappointed in the conveyance he lacked. “Ardh, you can explain this to elves better than I can; stop passing your duties off to me.”  

“Ah, come now, don’t be like that\!” Ardhari reassured. “Surely you’d know the tale by heart after hearing me say it time and again, no?”  

“You talk too fast.” frowned Ramanari.  

“Better than talking too slow; nobody likes the sound of a seller who can’t strike at the heart like a rapid river\! Am I right or am I right, lass?”  

*Why ask me? I’m not the merchant here, y’know.*  

Silence loomed over the three of them as Shenael and Ramanari both kept their mouths shut. The only alleviation to such an affliction was the consistent crackling of the fresh meat above the clay box.   

“Eh, alright then, keep your thoughts, you two.” grumbled Ardhari. “I’ll just finish this up knowing–”  

“Answer us now\!\! What manner of poison did you bring into our lands\!?”  

The distant, deep voice of a man shook the district, catching the attention of its majority.  
Shenael looked over to see another human merchant being harassed by…  

*Knights? And of the Meda division, too…*  

“Sir, I’ve told you every day I’ve been here, these are tonics from Zantche\! And so are the talis–”  

“So you say, human, but there is reason to believe otherwise. You’re under suspicion for playing a hand in a recent *hushpoppy* addiction problem crawling in these streets,” the other knight spat venomously.  

Murmurs began to circulate around the civilians. None of the civilians seemed willing to step in for some reason.  

Ramanari was the first to comment from afar. “I recognize them. They questioned us  two days ago.”  

“Ah-hah, so they’ve found a different target this time.” Ardhari said as he wrapped each of the skewers in a cloth. “Poor guy looks too old to be dealing with that kind of thing.”   

“You know those two knights?” asked Shenael.  

“They came by the day before yesterday all like ‘what’s in those spices? You better not have brought that *nirvana* stuff into our lands\!\!’” Ardhari showed no restraint mocking the deep voice of the knight. “So I handed them a few of my skewers, and they almost arrested us because the bearded one over there couldn’t handle the spice at all\!”  

“Had it not been for some of our customers–” Ramanari started.  

“And that stare of the Demon you got; don’t forget that now.” Ardhari interjected.  

*So they’ve been at this without warrants, too.*  

“...Hmph, anyway, if it hadn’t been for them, we would have nothing to sell anymore.”  
Ardhari had put all the four skewers in a bag and handed it to Shenael. “They likely can’t arrest that man if the accusations turn out false, but that’s never stopped any knight before. I get that drugs and plants go through rigorous checks here, but is it normal for them to be so uppity about it?”  

“...No.” Shenael had equipped her fingerless gloves during the exposition.  

“Uh, what are–”  

“You hold the bag for now, I’ll handle this. Be ready to call for a *healer*.” She wasted no time walking towards the scene.  

“Why a healer? This seems like more of a ‘knight-on-knight’ issue, no…?” Ardhari called.  

“Brother.” Ramanari put a hand on his shoulder. “We should listen to her.”  

Whatever conversation those two were having dissipated as she walked up to the stall where the two knights conducted their interrogation against the Zantchean merchant. As she got a closer look at all three of them, Shenael noticed a row of tonics, a row of talismans, and a row of arcane charms behind the merchant. He was a thin, bearded human with pale skin and age past whatever prime he may have had.   

*This looks like a variety shop, not one specifically for medicine and the like. Even if those tonics are foreign, questioning that human to this extent…*  

“Enough of this\! You will disclose all the contents of your wares to us, or face the– eh?” The gruff knight, a bearded light man with a stocky, tall build, immediately noticed Shenael being the only one to confront him.  

*…It pisses me off.*  

Both him and his companion, another light man with long blonde locks and a narrow glare, carried peculiar looking blades sheathed at the hip. Though Shenael did not recognize them, the hilts, adorned in black and crimson, radiated a distinct malevolence. Whether it was their foreign nature or a magical prowess she didn’t recognize yet, it was clear these blades were to ensure no interference from the civilians that cowered this time.  

“Away with you, girl\! This investigation stands between us and this human\!” declared the bearded knight.   

“Does it, now? You’re disturbing the crowd over something so trivial here. And this doesn’t seem like a shady business or anything.” Shenael fired back before turning to the Zantchean merchant. “What do you sell here?”  

“Ah, uh, well, I’m just bringing some valuable goods over from Zantche, my homeland, but…” The Zantchean merchant stammered as he got his bearings together. “These two, they’ve been asking about my wares for the past few days and–”  

“We’ve asked time and again for you to hand over the smuggled poisons and you have not complied.” snapped the long haired knight.  

The threat did not stop the Zantchean merchant from pleading with Shenael. “Please, ma’am, I’m ever so sorry to ask this of you, but these two won’t listen to a human like me, even after I gave them free samples of my work. Can you–”  

“The girl will not save you. Now stop resisting and come with us al–”  

“Wait, Desmeus.” The bearded knight stopped him with a hand.  

“What, Rekolos?” asked the knight named Desmeus.  

“This is no ordinary girl; she is Princess Shenael\! Lady Shenael, of the Lunendra clan\!” The knight named Rekolos kneeled with one fist on the floor. “I beg forgiveness for both mine and my subordinate’s methods; this human is a suspect we simply cannot let around these parts. Permit us knights of the *Meda* division to give a report.”  

*I’ll let these two talk for a bit before I knock their lights out.*  

Shenael folded her arms as she stared down Rekolos. “Would a variety store like this bother carrying *hushpoppy*? There’s already a process for checking that at the border, and I’ve heard that isn’t common in Zantche anymore.”   

“And yet, there is a rise in *addictions* for it in this kingdom, my lady. Of all the suspects we’ve attempted to track, this man is connected to them.”  

“There’s no way I’d be\! If I was, these tonics would be far murkier\! You see how clear they are, right…uh, your Majesty?” said the Zantchean merchant, unsure of what the correct address for Xaede royalty was.  

“How interesting. Do tell, how would you know that?” Desmeus unsheathed his sword, revealing a red sigil of diamond outlines in the blade’s fuller. As he pointed it at the now terrified merchant, the other civilians backed away, some exclaiming in shock and horror. 

“B-b-because I-I-I…oh, gods, please, I beg, spare me, I–”  

“Answer\! How do you know–”  

“Alright, stop, I’ve seen more than enough. You’re not actual knights of the *Meda* division.” interrupted Shenael.  

Rekolos got up from his kneeling position and Desmeus lowered his sword.   

Both of them stared at her in confusion.  

“I beg your pardon, Lady Shenael?” inquired Rekolos.  

“Proper *Meda* knights know how to follow the law without compromise so well, it’s almost trite. For instance, they’d never draw their swords on a human merchant, let alone bring ones as foreign as what you’re holding there.” Shenael pointed at Desmeus, almost compelled to drop his weapon.   

The murmurs around the crowd were reduced to a whisper in the presence of royalty.   

“...Because they lack the spine for this mission.” growled Desmeus. “As the times change, so must our security towards what goes in and what comes out. You’ve already heard this human spell the difference between what is spiked and what is–”  

“Probably because he’s studied this kind of thing before. Do you see any cloudy tonics on his shelf?” Shenael’s finger moved to the top row of the merchant’s wares as she stepped closer.  

Before Desmeus could start, Rekolos silenced him with a raised hand, then lowered his head to Shenael. “My lady, please understand; Xaede cannot turn a blind eye to a hushpoppy addiction ignited by humans. We–”  

“Yeah, the Hushpoppy Epidemic of 450 isn’t rare knowledge; everyone here knows how much Xaede got set back by it. So if there was a resurgence, the Sages would know, and so would I.”  

Rekolos subtly gripped his blade as she closed the distance. “That’s why we’re here to stamp it out ourselves. Now stand aside before one of us does something we’ll both regre–”  

**CRACK.**  

Before he could finish or notice, Shenael uppercutted his chin\!   

Then she fiercely nailed his face with a left hook and a right hook, sending him to the floor\!  

As gasps overcame the crowd, she slowly approached a shocked Desmeus like a predator stalking its prey. His hands shook as he gripped his blade with both hands.  

“*You*\!\!”   

He slashed downward with full force, blade roaring with a sinister red as it cleaved air.   

But Shenael weaved to her right and swung her right leg into his side, excising the air out of his lungs\!   

Before he could catch his breath, she clinched his head and–  

**SMASH.**  

With all her might, she slammed her right knee into his face\!\!  

Desmeus dropped his sword and stumbled about as a river of blood began to leak from both of his crushed nostrils. He muttered something unintelligible before falling face-first on the ground.  

Rekolos had just wiped the blood off his mouth. He looked up to see Shenael with one leg extended upwards to the sky. While he tried to get up–  

**CRASH.**  

Like a hammer, she swung her foot down into the back of his skull, planting his face straight into the pavement\!\!  

And with that, the battle concluded.   

Yet a tense air still lingered as Shenael caught her own breath.  

She checked his neck for a pulse. It was still beating, and so was the magic inside him.  

Unlatching the sword from Rekolos’s hilt, its sickening presence crawled in her palm.  

*Urgh…if I didn’t catch ‘em off guard, who knows what these could have done.*  

Though signs of applause were audible, her ears could not tune out the murmurs:

<br>

“Is that truly Lunendra’s heir? Her?”  
“How brutal…will those two live after this?”  
“Those knights may have been imposters, but still…”  
“Why is no one cheering? The day’s been saved, right?”  
“What frightening swords…”

<br>

Though years had passed for her to adapt to such word of mouth, her ears still rang in its presence. The pain only subsided when, in the midst of the commotion, a clearer voice she had long anticipated came onto the scene.   

“Excuse us, we heard there were knights in need of a healer and came to…what the\!?”  

Four healers in black cloaks had arrived, two of which had a staff on hand.  

“Ah, good, you’re all on time.” called Shenael after picking up both of the sinister blades in their sheaths.  

“L-lady Shenael? W-w-what happened here?” stammered the staff holder who had called out, a dark lady with freckles and spectacles.  

“These two *Meda* knights tried to arrest this human on false charges. They said it was about stamping out a hushpoppy resurgence, but I’m pretty sure they’re rogue pretenders who tried to imprison him so they could take all his wares. And from what I’ve just heard, they’ve been doing that to other human merchants, too.”  

“O-oh, I see.” the healer nodded as she scribbled down notes for Shenael’s report on a notepad.  

“You can ask around, there’s a crowd here of witnesses to tell you more. As for those two…” She pointed to Desmeus’s unconscious body.   

“Give them some basic treatment for their bleeding and transfer them to further questioning. And here’s the weapons they carried around to fend off the crowd here. Have these confiscated and appraised for the investigation. If there’s anything grave that comes up for it, send a report to me or my father if I’m not around.” commanded Shenael whilst handing both of the sheathed blades to one of the other healers.

“I-it shall be d-done then, my lady.” The spectacled healer finished writing her notes, and with her three other coworkers, immediately got to work carrying the bodies of the knights off the district.  

“Are you okay there, ser?” Shenael called to the Zantchean merchant, struggling to stand with one hand on his chest, another on his stall desk.  

He heaved sighs of exhaustion and relief to pull himself back together. “Oh…no need to…worry, I’ll be fine after a…bit. This isn’t a…sickness or anything, it’s just that…too much has happened for these…old bones to keep up.”  

She patted him on the back. “I can promise you those *Meda* knights were rare outliers. What happened today was new for me too.”  

“I…figured…” he heaved. “The ones at…the gates were very nice as they…checked my wares. Apologies…I wish I was in a state to…greet royalty like yourself, but–”  

“Hey, don’t worry, it’s fine, alright?” Shenael reassured. “You just hang in there, alright? Don’t be afraid to see the medics if your condition gets worse. News travels pretty fast around here, so I think they’ll recognize you at the nearest medical ward around.”  

“Thank you…I think I’ll do…just that later.” he nodded as he wheezed.  

She walked back to the ARKH stall to pick up her skewers, where Ardhari sat dumbfounded.   

“Don’t mind him.” Ramanari quickly stated. “He’s not used to women fighting as well as you did.”  

“*Hey*\!\! Shut up, you\!” Ardhari broke out of his trance to chide his brother’s joke. “I just wasn’t expecting any of that, is all\! There’s plenty of warrior women well versed in martial arts in our motherland\!” He wiped his forehead with a cloth and turned to Shenael with the bag of skewers in hand. “Anyway, here’s your lunch, ‘Lady Shenael.’ I made sure to keep it nice and piping hot while you dealt some justice\!”  

“Oh, thanks for that.” she nodded, taking the bad “Hopefully this kind of thing doesn’t keep happening around for a while. You two…”  

She trailed off as the murmurs intensified, unwilling to be tuned out:

<br>

“Hopefully those two ruffians aren’t how all the knights get taught these days…”  
“Such an uncouth way to fight\! It’s unbecoming of an heir to a Sage."  
“But Elder Sage Rueltabre also fights that way, right? Was he also that violent? I don’t remember.”  
“If Princess Vega were here, perhaps things would have been resolved differently.”  
“Heh, what a farce you people uphold\! Back in my century, true elves wouldn’t fear a punch or such ridiculous looking blades\!”  
“Is that human okay? Condolences to him…”

<br>

*Godsdamn it, I need to get out of here already.*  

“...You two take care, now. I’ll remember you both when I visit Yajurv someday.” she said before quickly walking off.   

*Gotta cool off the only way I know how.*  

While walking along the routine path from the city to her training grounds in the glades, she rummaged through the bag and bit into a glistening skewer.   

*Whoa, this is good. It’s nice I got this for a good price, but…it’s all still bugging me.*  

Its balance between juicy meats and natural mango spice she had never experienced before was more than enough to please the stomach and freshen her mouth.  

*What the hell is happening in Axiom?*  

Yet it did not wash the ringing out of her ears.
